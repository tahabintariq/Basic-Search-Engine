574602,Trash (video game),Storyline,"The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where after the great nuclear war of 2015 peace treaties were signed nuclear weapons were destroyed and civilization was slowly rebuilt. However 8 years after treaties were signed a fleet of alien ships appeared outside Earth's atmosphere. Several super weapons were fired from the largest of the alien spacecraft the resulting explosions causing major alterations to Earth's geography. Fearing for the lives of every human on earth the United States Government unleashed its hidden nuclear arsenal on the alien ships. The resulting explosions rained down onto the planet causing buildings to be destroyed and the air to be poisoned by radiation. As a result in 10 hours 5 of the 9 billion humans on Earth were killed.

The remaining smaller alien ships traveled into Earth's atmosphere but never landed due to resistance by the remaining humans on earth.

After the alien ships left mutants slowly began to appear initially doing nothing more than raiding human settlements for building materials and kidnapping humans. As these incidents were few and far between and by now many people had lost much of their families and other social contacts most of these went unnoticed.

However the mutants had their own plans. The mutants were hybrids of the aliens that came to conquer Earth. They injected captured humans with their own DNA causing them to mutate. Eventually the mutants' forces were strong enough to take on the humans. The mutants deployed their forces and the war between the humans and mutants began.

679231,Zeta Aquarii,Etymology,"In the catalogue of stars in the ''Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket'' this star was designated '''Achr al Achbiya''' ('''أجر ألأجبية''' - ''akhir al ahbiyah'') which was translated into Latin as '''Postrema Tabernaculorum''' meaning ''the end of luck of the homes (tents)''. This star along with γ Aqr (Sadachbia) π Aqr (Seat) and η Aqr (Hydria) were '''al Aḣbiyah''' ('''الأخبية''') the Tent.

735546,Génépi,Geographical origins,"The wormwoods known as génépi are endemic to the Alps and Pyrenees but can also be found in the Apennines and other mountainous regions in the western and central north Mediterranean. However in the strictest sense the name génépi applies only to those members of the genus Artemisia growing in the Savoy region known as Genepi. While the name clearly reflects a geographical origin the European Union does not protect French génépi liqueur under its Protected Geographical Status system. Instead as of 2008 while génépi  is recognized as a category of spirit to be regulated by the EU only génépi of Italian origin (from Val d’Aosta and Piemonte) is protected. Under the EU legislation the name génépi is limited in use to those Italian products but unlike under systems of appellation there are few regulations or limitations on how the product is produced or what ingredients are used in making it. A beverage may be labelled and sold as génépi only if it complies with general EU requirements for liqueur such as a minimum sugar content (expressed as invert sugar) of 100 grams per litre.

Swiss chocolate is sold in France (and no doubt elsewhere) with the wording in English (as well as in French and German) ""Milk Chocolate with a Swiss Genepi Liquor filling"". 

As of 2011 it does not appear that the French AOC system recognizes génépi from Savoy or anywhere else.

===Morning Reading===
Moon donated close to  to Morning Reading a non-profit organization that promotes reading books. She gave  in 2005  in 2006 and  in 2007. Moon made the contributions secretly through her mother Ryu Seon-young but her good deeds became known when Morning Reading revealed its 2007 account information online.

===Haenam Children's Center===
Moon donated about  in 2006 to a learning center for poor children in Haenam County South Jeolla Province near her hometown of Gwangju. Bae Yo-seop opened an after-school study room for children from poor or single-parent families to study there for free in 2002. The program was facing closure in October 2006 when the landlord told Bae that the house would be sold. A new building equipped with library computer room bathhouse and dining room was built on the land and the  expense was also covered by Moon. Moon also paid an unannounced visit to their classrooms.

===Community Chest of Korea===
Moon donated more than  over the last ten years to the Community Chest of Korea a nationwide network of 16 nonprofit fundraising organizations becoming the biggest individual donor. Moon had wanted to remain an anonymous donor but the organization was pressured by a media frenzy to identify her. Her donations were used to build children's libraries and subsidize hospital costs for children suffering from leukemia or cancer. Apart from the Community Chest of Korea Moon has also given several hundred millions of won to scholarship foundations.

Because of her charitable activities particularly for the Community Chest of Korea Moon was selected among 100 people that ""lit up the world"" in 2008 in a survey conducted by the Korea Green Foundation.

===Hangeul Library in Sydney===
Moon again showed her generosity by building a Korean library for young Korean expatriates in Australia. Working with the Lindfield Korean School in Sydney the actress donated  towards construction of a permanent Korean library (called the Hangeul Library) and also donated 10000 books to over 40 Korean schools scattered across the city. Moon has been donating books with her own money since 2006 when she saw during a visit to her relatives in Australia how young Korean students there did not have enough books or places to learn Korean.

===Donated Haenam Children's Center to NGO Group===
In April 2009 Moon donated the Haenam Children's Center to be used as a study room for poor students to the NGO group Good People an international charity group of UN UCOSCO special consultative status aiming to improve self-sustainability and eradicate extreme poverty through restoration of self-esteem using the principles of human dignity and equality at a global level.

===College===
Born in Stone Mountain Georgia Wolff played three years of college soccer at the University of South Carolina where he scored 21 goals and eight assists in 43 games. He played at South Carolina with future United States national team star Clint Mathis. In addition Wolff played and captained varsity soccer at Parkview High School Lilburn Georgia.

===Professional===
After his junior season Wolff left college and signed with Major League Soccer. MLS assigned Wolff to the Chicago Fire. He set the MLS rookie scoring record (together with Jeff Cunningham since broken by Damani Ralph) by scoring eight goals doing so in just 14 games with only four starts. Wolff played the following four seasons for the Fire scoring 24 goals but suffered through multiple injuries.

Before the 2003 MLS Superdraft the Fire traded Wolff in a cost-cutting move to the Kansas City Wizards in exchange for the third overall pick which the Fire used to select Nate Jaqua.  Wolff missed most of the 2003 season due to injuries.  He rebounded in 2004 by scoring ten goals and seven assists during the season. Wolff scored his first career playoff goal on a penalty kick during the MLS Cup 2004. He scored ten goals and ten assists in 2005.

In September 2006 Wolff had a try out with English Championship club Derby County. The team was pleased enough with his performance to offer MLS a $500000 transfer fee. However British immigration officials denied Wolff a work permit based on the fact he had failed to play the required 75% of the U.S. national team's games in the previous two years.

From England Wolff traveled to Germany for a try out with 2. Fußball-Bundesliga club 1860 Munich. On December 6 2006 1860 Munich signed Wolff to a contract through the 2007–2008 season. Munich paid MLS a $191000 transfer fee. Wolff joined the team during its January 2007 mid-winter training camp but was waived at the end of the 2008 season.

Wolff signed with the Kansas City Wizards on June 30 2008. At the end of the 2010 MLS season after two and a half seasons back in Kansas City Wolff's contract option was declined by the club.

On December 15 2010 Wolff was selected by D.C. United in Stage 2 of the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft and immediately signed a one-year contract with a club option for 2012.

Wolff announced his retirement on November 28 2012 and became a full-time assistant coach with D.C. United. He joined the Columbus Crew in November 2013.

===International===
Wolff during training for the U.S. national team
Wolff has scored nine goals in fifty-two caps since his debut against Jamaica on September 8 1999. He also starred for the US in the 2000 Summer Olympics scoring two goals and helping the team to a fourth-place finish. As with his club teams however Wolff has had trouble securing a definite spot because of continual injury problems. He did play for the United States in the 2002 World Cup assisting on the opening goal in the second-round win against Mexico. On May 2 2006 Wolff was named to the US roster for the FIFA World Cup in Germany. Wolff played his last national team match versus Spain at Estadio El Sardinero on June 4 2008.

481866,Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations,Background,"
Just prior to Saddam's invasion of Kuwait Saddam turned to religion perhaps to bolster his government (for example adding the words ""God is Great"" in Arabic to the flag and referring to God in his speeches).  After Saddam lost the Gulf War (and facing widespread rebellions from the Shia majority) he identified more closely with Islam by hosting international conferences and broadcasting Islamic sermons on national radio. In 1994 Saddam began his ""Faith Campaign"" in which he began to build mosques changed laws to outlaw public drinking required Baathist officials to attend prayers and held Quran reciting competitions.

Some sources allege that several meetings between top Iraqi operatives and bin Laden took place but these claims have been disputed by many other sources including most of the original intelligence agencies that investigated these sources in the first place. Many in the intelligence community are skeptical about whether such meetings if they took place at all ever resulted in any meaningful relationship. Many of the claims of actual collaboration seem to have originated with people associated with the Iraqi National Congress whose credibility has been impeached and who have been accused of manipulating the evidence in order to lure the United States into war on false pretenses. In addition many of the raw intelligence reports came to the awareness of the public through the leaking of a memo sent from Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas J. Feith to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence the conclusions of which have been disputed by intelligence agencies including the CIA.  Feith’s view of the relationship between Saddam and Osama differed from the official view of the intelligence community.  The memo was subsequently leaked to the media.  The Pentagon issued a statement cautioning that the memo was ""a classified annex containing a list and description of the requested reports so that the committee could obtain the reports from the relevant members of the intelligence community...The classified annex was not an analysis of the substantive issue of the relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda and it drew no conclusions.""  The Pentagon warned that ""Individuals who leak or purport to leak classified information are doing serious harm to national security; such activity is deplorable and may be illegal."" Former head of the Middle East section of the DIA W. Patrick Lang told the Washington Post that the Weekly Standard article which published Feith's memo ""is a listing of a mass of unconfirmed reports many of which themselves indicate that the two groups continued to try to establish some sort of relationship. If they had such a productive relationship why did they have to keep trying?""  And according to the Post ""another former senior intelligence official said the memo is not an intelligence product but rather 'data points ... among the millions of holdings of the intelligence agencies many of which are simply not thought likely to be true.'""

Some have suggested that an understanding was reached between Iraq and al-Qaeda namely that al-Qaeda would not act against Saddam in exchange for Iraqi support primarily in the form of training.  No evidence of such an understanding has ever been produced.  Some reports claim that Mohamed Atta met with an Iraqi intelligence operative in Prague but intelligence officials have concluded that no such meeting took place. A training camp in Salman Pak south of Baghdad was said by a number of defectors to have been used to train international terrorists (assumed to be al-Qaeda members) in hijacking techniques using a real airplane as a prop. The defectors were inconsistent about a number of details. The camp has been examined by U.S. Marines and intelligence analysts do not believe it was used by al-Qaeda. Some of these analysts believe it was actually used for counterterrorism training while others believe it was used to train foreign fighters overtly aligned with Iraq. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded that ""Postwar findings support the April 2002 Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) assessment that there was no credible reporting on al-Qa'ida training at Salman Pak or anywhere else in Iraq. There have been no credible reports since the war that Iraq trained al-Qa'ida operatives at Salman Pak to conduct or support transnational terrorist operations.""

In November 2001 a month after the September 11th attacks Mubarak al-Duri was contacted by Sudanese intelligence services who informed him that the FBI had sent Jack Cloonan and several other agents to speak with a number of people known to have ties to Bin Laden. al-Duri and another Iraqi colleague agreed to meet with Cloonan in a safe house overseen by the intelligence service. They were asked whether there was any possible connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda and laughed stating that Bin Laden hated the dictator who he believed was a ""Scotch-drinking woman-chasing apostate.”

298927,Hringhorni,Mythology,"According to ''Gylfaginning'' following the murder of Baldr by Loki the other gods brought his body down to the sea and laid him to rest on the ship. They would have launched it out into the water and kindled a funeral pyre for Baldr but were unable to move the great vessel without the help of the giantess Hyrrokkin who was sent for out of Jötunheim. She then flung the ship so violently down the rollers at the first push that flames appeared and the earth trembled much to the annoyance of Thor.

Along with Baldr his wife Nanna was also borne to the funeral pyre after she had died of grief. As Thor was consecrating the fire with his hammer Mjolnir a dwarf named Litr began cavorting at his feet. Thor then kicked him into the flames and the dwarf was burned up as well. The significance of this seemingly incidental event is speculative but may perhaps find a parallel in religious ritual. Among other artifacts and creatures sacrificed on the pyre of ''Hringhorni'' were Odin's gold ring Draupnir and the horse of Baldr with all its trappings.

390758,Post–World War I recession,North America,"In North America the recession immediately following World War I was extremely brief lasting for only 7 months from August 1918 to March 1919.  A second much more severe recession sometimes labeled a depression began in January 1920.  Several indices of economic activity suggest the recession was moderately severe.  The Axe-Houghton Index of Index of Trade and Industrial Activity declined by 14.1% in this recession (compared to a 31% decline in the Panic of 1907).  The Babson index of physical volume of business activity declined by 28.6% in this recession (compared to a 2.3% decline in the 1921 recession and a 22.7% decline in the Panic of 1907).

117317,Consumer choice,Introduction,"
The theory of '''consumer choice''' is the branch of microeconomics that relates preferences to consumption expenditures and to consumer demand curves. It analyzes how consumers maximize the 
desirability of their consumption as measured by their preferences subject to limitations on their expenditures by maximizing utility subject to a consumer budget constraint.

Consumption is separated from production logically because two different economic agents are involved. In the first case consumption is by the primary individual; in the second case a producer might make something that he would not consume himself. Therefore different motivations and abilities are involved. The models that make up consumer theory are used to represent prospectively observable demand patterns for an individual buyer on the hypothesis of constrained optimization.  Prominent variables used to explain the rate at which the good is purchased (demanded) are the price per unit of that good prices of related goods and wealth of the consumer.

The law of demand states that the rate of consumption falls as the price of the good rises even when the consumer is monetarily compensated for the effect of the higher price; this is called the substitution effect. As the price of a good rises consumers will substitute away from that good choosing  more of other alternatives. If no compensation for the price rise occurs as is usual then the decline in overall purchasing power due to the price rise leads for most goods to a further decline in the quantity demanded; this is called the income effect.

In addition as the wealth of the individual rises demand for most products increases shifting the demand curve higher at all possible prices.

The basic problem of consumer theory takes the following inputs:
* The '''consumption set''' ''C'' – the set of all bundles that the consumer could conceivably consume.
* A preference relation over the bundles of ''C''. This preference relation can be described as an ordinal utility function describing the utility that the consumer derives from each bundle.
* A '''price system''' which is a function assigning a price to each bundle.
* An '''initial endowment''' which is a bundle from ''C'' that the consumer initially holds. The consumer can sell all or some of his initial bundle in the given prices and can buy another bundle in the given prices. He has to decide which bundle to buy under the given prices and budget in order to maximize his utility.

751042,The Net (album),Introduction,"




'''''The Net''''' is the seventh studio album by Little River Band which was released in May 1983. It marks what has become historically the major crossroad in the band's musical direction. There stand several significant factors surrounding this record – it contained the band's last two singles to reach the Top 40 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in the United States with ""We Two"" reaching No. 22 and ""You're Driving Me out of My Mind"" peaking at No. 35. The album peaked at No. 11 on the Australian Kent Music Report albums chart and No. 61 on the ''Billboard'' 200.

''The Net'' was their first full studio release to feature John Farnham as new lead vocalist replacing Glenn Shorrock and Stephen Housden taking up the mantle of lead guitarist. It is also the last album featuring original members lead guitarist Beeb Birtles who permanently left the line-up after the US Tour in support of its release and drummer Derek Pellicci who would rejoin the band in 1987.

497227,Languages of Uganda,Languages,"In all of the Bantu speaking areas of Uganda dialect continua are very common. For example people around Mbarara speak Nkole and people from Fort Portal in Toro District speak Tooro but in the area between those towns there are villages where most of the people speak a dialect that is best characterised as intermediate between Nkole and Tooro. In recognition of the closeness of four of these languages (Nkole Tooro Kiga and Nyoro) and to facilitate work in them such as teaching a standardised version called ""Runyakitara"" was developed around 1990.

In south central Uganda the Bantu languages of Luganda and Soga are largely interintelligible. This dialectic similarity also extends to the Lussese language spoken in the Ssese Islands of Lake Victoria.

Of Nilo-Saharan the Eastern Sudanic branch is well represented by several Nilotic languages eastern as well as western. Eastern Nilotic languages include Karamojong of eastern Uganda (population 370000) the Bari languages in the extreme north-western corner (about 150000 population) and Teso south of Lake Kyoga (999537 population). Alur (population 459000) Acholi Lango Adhola and Kuman of eastern Uganda are Western Nilotic Luo languages. (Acholi and Lango are interintelligible and sometimes the term ""Luo"" is used to cover them.)

Some southern Nilotic Kalenjin languages are spoken along the border with Kenya including Pokot and the Elgon languages near Kupsabiny. The eastern Ugandan Kuliak languages Ik and Soo are also members of the Eastern Sudanic branch. Lugbara Aringa Ma'di and Ndo of north-western Uganda are languages of the Central Sudanic branch of Nilo-Saharan.

286307,Cornerstone (software),History and development,"In the 1980s Infocom was widely known as a computer game developer and publisher.  It developed the most popular works of interactive fiction available at the time and in fact can be considered a pioneer of the genre.

However games were only considered a ""jumping off"" point for the company.  Infocom was originally established as an outlet to develop ""serious"" products.  Before forming the company several of the founders had created the game ''Zork'' on mainframes while attending or working at MIT.  When they joined to form Infocom ''Zork'' was a natural choice as a first product because it was practically complete and didn't require much up-front funding.  The enormous success of the game and its ""sequels"" (which were actually the other portions of the original mainframe game which had been split into pieces that early personal computers could handle) led to the development of more interactive titles due in large part to the highly portable technology the company developed for intelligent parsing.  Despite the overwhelming success of its numerous game titles the original founders of Infocom were still intent on developing serious titles.  In addition business software was seen as more lucrative than game titles since business traditionally paid thousands of dollars for each copy of software applications. After some deliberation Infocom's board of directors decided to develop a relational database application for business users.

===Contemporary databases===
Database applications contemporary with Cornerstone were fairly inaccessible to non-programmers.  The leading database application of the day ''dBase II'' required complex command-line commands even for the simplest operations.  The Cornerstone developers were determined to make ease-of-use their chief priority. Dozens of people were hired in programming marketing and other areas to swell Infocom's ranks to over 100 employees.

===Funding===
While development of Cornerstone was going well it required an enormous amount of capital.  Infocom borrowed heavily and used a sole source of venture capital.  Profits from their interactive fiction titles were diverted to help fund Cornerstone a move that disturbed many employees of the game division and led to an adversarial attitude towards the business division among some.

===Design decisions===
One development decision that proved fateful for the product—and the company as a whole—was the decision to make Cornerstone run via a virtual machine (VM).  The use of Infocom's ""Z-machine"" for its interactive titles had been a huge boon: since all the games were written in an intermediate language (called ZIL) the company could release one title for every major platform simultaneously.  The developers hoped to do the same for Cornerstone and its subsequent products.  The existing VM proved unsuitable for the database application so a new one was written for the product.  The developers produced the VM for the IBM PC first planning to write VMs for other platforms after the initial PC release.

24484,Gas laws,Combined and Ideal Gas Laws,"
The Combined Gas Law or General Gas Equation is obtained by combining Boyle's Law Charles' Law and Gay-Lussac's Law. It shows the relationship between the pressure volume and temperature for a fixed mass (quantity) of gas:

:

This can also be written as:

:

With the addition of Avogadro's Law the combined gas law develops into the Ideal Gas Law:

:

:where

:''p'' is pressure
:''V'' is volume
:''n'' is the number of moles
:''R'' is the universal gas constant
:''T'' is temperature (K)

:where the proportionality constant now named R is the universal gas constant with a value of 8.3144598 (kPa∙L)/(mol∙K). An equivalent formulation of this Law is:

:

:where

:''P'' is the pressure
:''V'' is the volume
:''N'' is the number of gas molecules
:''k'' is the Boltzmann constant (1.381×10−23 J·K−1 in SI units)
:''T'' is the absolute temperature

These equations are exact only for an ideal gas which neglects various intermolecular effects (see real gas). However the ideal gas law is a good approximation for most gases under moderate pressure and temperature.

This law has the following important consequences:
# If temperature and pressure are kept constant then the volume of the gas is directly proportional to the number of molecules of gas.
# If the temperature and volume remain constant then the pressure of the gas changes is directly proportional to the number of molecules of gas present.
# If the number of gas molecules and the temperature remain constant then the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume.
# If the temperature changes and the number of gas molecules are kept constant then either pressure or volume (or both) will change in direct proportion to the temperature.

115608,Vermiculite,Controversy over health risks,"
The largest and oldest vermiculite mine in the United States was started in the 1920s at Libby Montana and the vermiculite was sold under the commercial name Zonolite. The Zonolite brand and the mine was acquired by the W.R. Grace Company in 1963.  Mining operations at the Libby site stopped in 1990 in response to asbestos contamination. While in operation the Libby mine may have produced 80% of the world's supply of vermiculite.

The United States government estimates that vermiculite was used in more than 35 million homes but does not recommend its removal. Nevertheless homes or structures containing vermiculite or vermiculite insulation dating from before the mid 1990s—and especially those known to contain the ""Zonolite"" brand—may contain asbestos and therefore may be a health concern.

An article published in the ''Salt Lake Tribune'' on December 3 2006 reported that vermiculite and Zonolite had been found to contain asbestos which had led to cancers such as those found in asbestos-related cases. The article stated that there had been a cover-up by W.R. Grace Company and others regarding the health risks associated with vermiculite and that several sites in the Salt Lake Valley had been remediated by the EPA when they were shown to be contaminated with asbestos. W.R. Grace Company has vigorously denied these charges.

The vermiculite deposit at the mine in Libby Montana was (and is) heavily contaminated with asbestos. Numerous people were knowingly exposed to the harmful dust of vermiculite that contained asbestos.  Unfortunately the mine had been operating since the 1920s and environmental and industrial controls were virtually non-existent until the mine was purchased by the W.R. Grace Company in 1963. Yet knowing the human health risks the mining company still continued to operate there until 1990. Consequently many of the former miners and residents of Libby have been affected and continue to suffer health problems. Over 400 people in the town have died from asbestos-related disease due to contamination from vermiculite mining from nearby Zonolite Mountain where soil samples were found to be loaded with fibrous tremolite (known to be a very hazardous form of asbestos) and countless others there who insulated their homes with Zonolite have succumbed to asbestos-related diseases most of whom never were employed in environments where asbestos was an issue.

After a 1999 ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'' story claimed that asbestos-related disease was common in the town the EPA in response to political pressure made cleanup of the site a priority and called Libby the worst case of community-wide exposure to a toxic substance in U.S. history. The EPA has spent $120 million in Superfund money on cleanup. In October 2006 W.R. Grace Company tried to appeal the fines ($54.5-million) levied on them from the EPA but the Supreme Court rejected the appeal. The United States government is also pursuing criminal charges against several former executives and managers of the mine for allegedly disregarding and covering up health risks to employees.  They are also accused of obstructing the government's cleanup efforts and wire fraud. To date according to the indictment approximately 1200 residents of the Libby area have been identified as suffering from some kind of asbestos-related abnormality. Jury selection was to have been completed in February 2009.
The case ended in acquittals on May 8 2009. On June 17 2009 the EPA issued a public health emergency in and near Libby thereby allowing federal agencies to provide funding for health care and for removal of contaminated insulation from affected homes.

252895,Toots Mondt,Professional wrestling career,"
===Early wrestling career===
Toots Mondt made his wrestling debut in Greeley in 1912 at the age of 18 in a carnival/wrestling style match a match he would wrestle in for many years. Stu Hart claimed he ran into Toots by chance while wrestling in New York City and that Mondt said he received his first wrestling lesson in 1916 from Jack Taylor and Mondt tried to recruit Hart into a territory in Washington D.C.  Around this time he also tried his hand at acrobatics. However this was an unsuccessful move and Toots returned to wrestling matches. Toots received his big break when he was discovered by wrestling pioneer Farmer Burns during one of his scouting trips. The nickname ‘Toots’ had to do with either his small feet or his relative youth and baby face. Mondt was the youngest wrestler in Farmer Burns' camp.

===Gold Dust Trio===

Until 1919 wrestling matches were slow-moving exhibitions mainly confined to the mat and lasting on an average 60 minutes. Crowds no longer found this to be suitable entertainment and accordingly they began to dwindle. Wrestling matches slowly and eventually became pre-determined. Toots Mondt joined the camp of Ed ""Strangler"" Lewis with the recommendation of Farmer Burns. Toots served in many capacities as a sparring partner trainer sometimes as an opponent and as a police officer. As a sparring partner and trainer Toots Mondt helped Ed Lewis develop new holds and counters. The working relationship and unity amongst wrestling promoters was beginning to wear thin and crowd attendance was still low. Toots conceived a solution and combined features of a boxing ring Greco-Roman freestyle wrestling and the old-time lumber-camp style of fighting. Toots had called it ’Slam Bang Western Style Wrestling’.

Toots Mondt's second plan was to promote this new style of wrestling on a much higher scale.  Toots convinced Ed Lewis and his manager Billy Sandow of forming their own promotion as opposed to having different promoters controlling them. The team of Mondt Lewis and Sandow used their connections to convince many other wrestlers to sign up. Under the control of Mondt Lewis and Sandow they served as bookers and agents. Toots also instituted time limits as wrestling matches would often go three or four hours. Within six months the ""Gold Dust Trio"" controlled the course of professional wrestling in North America. Their product was moved out from venues such as burlesque theaters and back alley halls to the major sports venue in each city. All new talent was tested in Billy Sandow's private ring while routines and finishes were carefully determined by Toots. The Gold Dust Trio later dissolved from a power struggle between Toots Mondt & Billy Sandow's brother Max.

Mondt then formed a partnership with Philadelphia promoter Ray Fabiani. The new combination wasted little time and found their new title holder in Dick Shickat a former circus strongman from Germany. Once Dick Shickat's title reign had run its course Mondt and Fabiani made Jim Londos their new champion and continued their hold on the Northeast. They soon expanded onto New York City Hartford Baltimore and Washington DC. Toots/Fabiani were unsuccessful because rival New York promoter Jack Curley prevented them from promoting in NYC for years and it was during this time that he came around an up-and-coming Lou Thesz with whom Mondt had a bad history. As Jack Curley was on his deathbed Toots realized that New York wrestling would fall apart. So Toots & Fabiani immediately formed an alliance with fellow booking heavyweight Rudy Dusek. This formation to take over New York was kept a secret. At Curley's funeral one of his sons approached Toots about taking over New York and was not aware that Toots had a plan. Toots also gained help from other bookers such as Jack Pfeffer the Johnston Brothers and Jess McMahon. Jess McMahon worked for boxing promoter and New York Rangers hockey franchise founder Tex Rickard who despised wrestling preventing bookings in Madison Square Garden (MSG) from 1939 to 1948. Toots found former wrestler turned millionaire Bernarr McFadden who gave Toots the financial backings.

Bernarr McFadden helped Toots promote in NYC and gain access into Madison Square Garden. In 1948 in the main event of the first card held in MSG for 9 years Gorgeous George defeated Ernie Dusek. In that same year Toots Mondt was in search for another champion. After several failed attempts Toots Mondt found Antonino Rocca who brought in more Latino fans to the matches which financially favored Toots. Mondt however was not able to keep Rocca happy and Vince McMahon Sr. was brought into the scene by Ray Fabiani.

===Birth of the World Wide Wrestling Federation===
In 1963 Toots Mondt and Vince McMahon Sr. broke away from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) renaming Capitol Wrestling Corporation to the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF).  Toots Mondt parted ways with NWA President Sam Muchnick on good terms so that the WWWF would not be seen as an enemy. Toots and Vince were also in the middle of fighting off an invasion by Jim Crockett Promotions from promoting in the WWWF territories.

When Buddy Rogers was crowned NWA World Heavyweight Champion Toots controlled the bookings for Rogers’ title defenses. Toots would rarely allow Buddy Rogers to defend the title outside the Northeastern region. This would be one of the factors which led to the World Wide Wrestling Federation splitting from the NWA. In April 1963 Buddy Rogers was awarded the WWWF World Heavyweight title supposedly for winning a  tournament for the title in Rio de Janeiro a fictitious storyline created by Toots Mondt. In 1965 Toots Mondt stepped down as promoter at Madison Square Garden and Vince McMahon Sr. took over. When Bruno Sammartino was brought into the WWWF Vince Sr. predicted that he would be a midcarder for two or three years at best. Toots called Sammartino the future of the company because people instantly liked and responded to him. Toots convinced Vince McMahon Sr. to build the company around Bruno Sammartino. In a June 2012 Wrestling Observer Radio podcast Bruno acknowledged that Mondt and Vince McMahon Sr. were not on the best of terms during his tenure with the company with Bruno suggesting it was due to the fallout over the promotion's handling of Buddy Rogers.

Changing times and the rise of television saw Mondt's influence in the sport diminishing. Mondt was an arena booker and was never able to get a handle on television like McMahon. That fact coupled with Mondt's gambling problems allowed his business-minded partner to muscle him out of ownership of the New York territory. Toots sold off his share to McMahon in the mid-60s. McMahon reduced Mondt to salaried employee for Capital. Mondt died nearly penniless on June 11 1976 at the age of 82 after a long battle with an illness. Since then he has been inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996 the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 2008 and the WWE Hall of Fame in 2017 as a recipient of its Legacy Award.

210867,Where Is My Gnome?,Overview,"The advertisements consisted of a man named ""Bill"" looking for his garden gnome. On January 3 the ''Boston Herald'' and the ''Boston Globe'' had these advertisements on their publication.  The advertisements were inspired by the travelling gnome prank. Since the initiation of the advertising campaign the ""'''Roaming Gnome'''"" has become the ''de facto'' mascot of Travelocity.

After TV advertisements voiced by Harry Enfield were screened nationally on United States networks and on a Web site ''whereismygnome.com'' many readers considered it to be a prank of the Garden Gnome Liberation Front.

The gnome remains in the commercials; however he is no longer held against his will but now works as ""The Roaming Gnome: Denouncer of Travel Myths.""  In these commercials he discusses two myths one where the gnome states that Travelocity's services are able to ""denounce"" the myth and the other where the gnome ends up causing a mess. In one such commercial he visits the Bermuda Triangle to see if things really do disappear there denouncing the myth even as objects disappear behind him until he also vanishes mid-sentence.

In 2006 a major promotion involved 20 Travelocity gnomes carefully hidden throughout the  atrium of Gaylord Palms Resort & Convention Center in Kissimmee Florida.  During the resort's  Best of Florida Christmas promotion guests were encouraged to find the gnomes to win a cruise to Alaska.

FFmpeg's maintainer Michael Niedermayer has criticised MPEG-4 for lacking an in-loop deblocking filter GMC being too computationally intensive and OBMC being defined but not allowed in any profiles among other things. Microsoft's Ben Waggoner states ""Microsoft (well before my time) went down the codec standard route before with MPEG-4 part 2 which turns out to be a profound disappointment across the industry - it didn't offer that much of a compression advantage over MPEG-2 and the protracted license agreement discussions scared off a lot of adoption. I was involved in many digital media projects that wouldn't even touch MPEG-4 in the late 1990s to early 2000s because there was going to be a 'content fee' that hadn't been fully defined yet.""

323418,Bleomycin,Introduction,"

'''Bleomycin''' is a medication used to treat cancer. This includes Hodgkin's lymphoma non-Hodgkin's lymphoma testicular cancer ovarian cancer and cervical cancer among others. Typically used with other cancer medications it can be given intravenously by injection into a muscle or under the skin. It may also be administered inside the chest to help prevent the recurrence of a fluid around the lung due to cancer; however talc is better for this.


Common side effects include fever weight loss vomiting and rash. A severe type of anaphylaxis may occur. It may also cause inflammation of the lungs that can result in lung scarring. Chest X-rays every couple of weeks are recommended to check for this. Bleomycin may cause harm to the baby if used during pregnancy. It is believed to primarily work by preventing the making of DNA.


Bleomycin was discovered in 1962. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is between 14 USD and 78 USD a dose. It is made by the bacterium ''Streptomyces verticillus''.

Driscoll was born south of Wichita Kansas on a farm that was purchased by his father after emigrating from Ireland by way of New York and Ohio.  Driscoll wrote of his life in Kansas in the ''Kansas Irish'' trilogy; the first two books published in 1943 (''Kansas Irish'') and 1946 (''Country Jake'') and the last ''East and West of Wichita'' in manuscript published in E-book by Rowfant Press in 2014.  ''Kansas Irish'' was republished by Rowfant Press in 2011 in an illustrated paperback edition introduction by Dr. Matthew Jockers.  He began his career as a journalist writing for the ''Wichita Eagle'' and is popularly credited as the originator of the ""school page"" in newspapers. Driscoll became editor of the ''Wichita Eagle'' in 1919 but was forced out of his position in the 1920s by the Ku Klux Klan active in Kansas politics at the time. Driscoll worked as an editor for the McNaught Syndicate from 1928 until his death and continued the popular ''New York Day by Day'' column after the death of its creator O. O. McIntyre in 1938. Dr. Matthew Jockers has written on the importance of Driscoll as a writer on the Irish in the West ""A Window Facing West: Charles Driscoll's Kansas Irish"" ''New Hibernia Review'' Volume 8 Number 3 helping to revive interest in his writing and life.

509523,Sub-Roman Britain,End of Roman Britain,"
Various dates have been proposed to mark the end of Roman Britain including the end of Roman currency coinage importation in 402 Constantine III's rebellion in 407 the rebellion mentioned by Zosimus in 409 and the Rescript of Honorius in 410. Unlike modern decolonisation the dating of the end of Roman Britain is complex and the exact process is unknown.

There is some controversy as to why Roman rule ended in Britain. The view first advocated by Wolfgang Mommsen was that Rome left Britain. This argument was substantiated over time most recently by A.S. Esmonde-Cleary. According to this argument internal turmoil in the Roman Empire and the need to withdraw troops to fight off barbarian armies led Rome to abandon Britain. It was the collapse of the imperial system that led to the end of imperial rule in Britain. However Michael Jones has advanced an alternative thesis that argues that Rome did not leave Britain but that Britain left Rome. He highlights the numerous usurpers who came from Britain in the late 4th and early 5th centuries and points out that the supply of coinage to Britain had dried up by the early 5th century so that administrators and troops were not getting paid. All of this he argues led the British people to rebel against Rome. Both of these arguments are open to criticism and the question is still open.

It was a violent period and there was probably widespread tension alluded to in all the written sources. This may have led to the deaths of many Britons. There are also references to plagues. Laycock (''Britannia the Failed State'' 2008) suggests tribal conflict possibly even starting before 410 may have sliced up much of Britain and helped destroy the economy. The evidence from land use suggests a decline in production which might be a sign of population decline.

It is clear that some British people migrated to Europe and Armorica in northwest Gaul became known as Brittany. There is also evidence of British migration to Gallaecia in Hispania. The dates of these migrations are uncertain but recent studies suggest that the migration from south western Britain to Brittany may have begun as early as 300 and had largely ended by 500. These settlers unlikely to be refugees if the date was this early made their presence felt in the naming of the westernmost Atlantic-facing provinces of Armorica Kerne/Cornouaille (""Kernow/Cornwall"") and Domnonea (""Devon""). However there is clear linguistic evidence for close contact between the south west of Britain and Brittany across the sub-Roman period.

In Galicia in the north west corner of the Iberian peninsula another region of traditional Celtic culture the Suebian ''Parochiale'' drawn up about 580 includes a list of the principal churches of each diocese in the metropolitanate of Braga (the ''ecclesia Britonensis'' now Bretoña) which was the seat of a bishop who ministered to the spiritual needs of the British immigrants to northwestern Spain: in 572 the bishop Mailoc had a Celtic name. The settlers had brought their Celtic Christianity with them but finally accepted the Latin Rite at the Council of Toledo in 633. The diocese stretched from Ferrol to the Eo River. In Spain the area has sometimes been dubbed ""the third Britain"" or ""the last Britain"".

Non-Anglo-Saxon kingdoms began appearing in western Britain and are first referred to in Gildas' ''De Excidio''. To an extent these kingdoms may have derived from Roman structures. But it is also clear that they drew on a strong influence from Hibernia which was never part of the Roman Empire. Archaeology has helped further the study of these kingdoms notably at sites like Tintagel or the South Cadbury hill-fort.

In the north there developed the British kingdoms of the Hen Ogledd the ""Old North"" comprising Ebrauc (probable name) Bryneich Rheged Strathclyde Elmet and Gododdin. Fifth and sixth century repairs along Hadrian's Wall have been uncovered and at Whithorn in south western Scotland (possibly the site of St Ninian's monastery). Chance discoveries have helped document the continuing urban occupation of some Roman towns such as Wroxeter and Caerwent. Continued urban use might be associated with an ecclesiastical structure.

Western Britain has attracted those archaeologists who wish to place King Arthur as a historical figure. Though there is little contemporary written evidence for this archaeological evidence does suggest that a Romano-British king might have wielded considerable power during the sub-Roman period as demonstrated by the creation of sites such as Tintagel and earthworks such as the Wansdyke. Such interpretations continue to attract the popular imagination and the scepticism of academics.

While pushed back politically and linguistically British scholars and ecclesiastics had a significant impact on the Anglo-Saxon newcomers through literacy ecclesiastical social constructs and historical memory of the Roman period in Britain particularly after the Christianizing of the Anglo-Saxons by Augustine. Coming from a fully oral cultural background the Anglo-Saxons were heavily influenced by the more developed Christianized and literate culture of the Britons. British scholars were often employed at Anglo-Saxon courts to assist in the management of the kingdoms. This reintroduced British culture to those parts of Britain lost to the British politically. The epitome of this process is the adoption of the legendary British war leader King Arthur as the national hero of the English due to the literary work of Welsh historians.

758496,Elliott Sober,Philosophy,"One of Sober's main fields of research has been the subject of simplicity or parsimony in connection with theory evaluation in science.  Sober also has been interested in altruism both as the concept is used in evolutionary biology and also as it is used in connection with human psychology.  His book with David Sloan Wilson ''Unto Others: the Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior'' (1998) addresses both topics.

Sober has been a prominent critic of intelligent design.  He also has written about evidence and probability scientific realism and instrumentalism laws of nature the mind-body problem and naturalism.

=== Philosophy of biology ===
Sober's ''The Nature of Selection: Evolutionary Theory in Philosophical Focus'' (1984) has been instrumental in establishing the philosophy of biology as a prominent research area in philosophy. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ""''The Nature of Selection''...marks the point at which most philosophers became aware of the philosophy of biology."" In his review of the book biologist Ernst Mayr wrote ""Sober has ... given us what is perhaps the most careful and penetrating analysis of the concept of natural selection as it affects the process of evolution"".

=== Parsimony ===
Sober's first publication on parsimony was his 1975 book ''Simplicity''. In it he argued that the simplicity of a hypothesis should be understood in terms of a concept of question-relative informativeness. Sober abandoned this theory in the 1980s when he started to think about the concept of cladistic parsimony used in evolutionary biology. This led him to think of parsimony in terms of the concept of likelihood an idea he developed in his 1988 book ''Reconstructing the Past -- Parsimony Evolution and Inference''. In the 1990s he started to think about the role of parsimony in model selection theory—for example in the Akaike Information Criterion. He published a series of articles in this area with Malcolm Forster the first of which was their 1994 paper ""How to Tell When Simpler More Unified or Less Ad Hoc Theories Will Provide More Accurate Predictions."" His most recent publication on parsimony his 2015 book ''Ockham's Razors -- A User's Manual'' describes both the likelihood framework and the model selection frameworks as two viable ""parsimony paradigms.""

128314,Radical behaviorism,Outgrowths,"There are radical behaviorist schools of animal training management clinical practice and education. Skinner's political views have left their mark in small ways as principles adopted by a small handful of utopian communities such as Los Horcones and in ongoing challenges to aversive techniques in control of human and animal behavior.

Radical behaviorism has generated numerous descendants. Examples of these include molar approaches associated with Richard Herrnstein and William Baum Howard Rachlin's teleological behaviorism William Timberlake's behavior systems approach and John Staddon's theoretical behaviorism.

Skinner's theories on verbal behavior have seen widespread application in therapies for autistic children that are based on applied behavior analysis (ABA).

19755,Hide-and-seek,Variants,"Different versions of the game are played around the world under a variety of names. One derivative in game is called ""Sardines"" in which only one person hides and the others must find them hiding with them when they do so. The hiding places become progressively more cramped like sardines in a tin. The last person to find the hiding group is the loser. A. M. Burrage calls this version of the game ""Smee"" in his 1931 ghost story of the same name.
Hide and Seek (painting 1881)
In some versions of the game after the first player is caught or if not any other players can be found over a period of time ""it"" calls out a pre-agreed phrase (such as ""Olly olly oxen free"" or ""All in All in Everybody out there all in free"") to signal the other hiders to return to base for the next round. In another version when players are caught they help the ""it"" seek out others.
The original term is ""All ye all ye come for free"". Over the years this term has taken on various phrases the most popular is ""Olly olly oxen free"".

In one variant once all hiders have been located the game then becomes a game of tag where the ""it"" chases after all the other players and the first person tagged becomes the ""it"".

In another the hiders who are found help the ""it"" track down the remaining hiders but the first person to be found becomes the next ""it.""

In some parts of Australia the game is called ""44 Homes."" The hiders hide until they are spotted by the seeker who chants ""Forty Forty I see you"" (sometimes shortened to ""Forty forty see you""). Once spotted the hider must run to ""home base"" (where the ""it"" was counting while the other players hid) and touch it before she or he is ""tipped"" (tagged or touched) by the seeker.  If tagged that hider becomes the new ""it.""

In India hide-and-seek is played differently – if any of the 'hiders' touch the seeker and says 'Dhappa' then the seeker has to count again. However if the seeker sees the hider before they manage to touch him/her and say dhappa then that hider will be 'it' the next round unless some other hider manages to 'Dhappa' the seeker without being seen.But now instead of doing Dhappa on the ""IT""s body hiders can do dhappa where the ""it"" counts. The ""it"" is simply called as ""Dianer"" (daa-ee-nuh-rr); and the dianers takes a dian.(count)

In Brazil and Russia hide-and-seek has an extra step. The ""it"" starts counting with eyes closed and facing the wall while everyone hides. Once the ""it"" finds someone they must race to the spot where the ""it"" was originally counting and facing the wall and whoever touches that spot first wins the game. This is also sometimes played by other countries.

260986,James Noble Tyner,Post Office frauds and investigation (1903),"Postmaster-General Henry C. Payne removed Tyner from office on April 22 1903
On March 7 1903 President Theodore Roosevelt launched an investigation into frauds in the Post Office. Early in April Postmaster-General Henry C. Payne informed Tyner who was under suspicion of corruption to resign office by a mutual friend . Tyner and Mrs. Tyner then pleaded with Payne to keep Tyner in office. Payne then postponed Tyner's resignation to May 1 and told Tyner he was suspended from duties as Assistant Attorney barring Tyner from his office. This left Tyner in a precarious position of technically being Assistant Attorney without administrative powers. Tyner instructed his wife to retrieve his official papers from the safe room in his Washington D.C. office on the fifth floor of the Postal Department. On Tuesday April 20 Mrs. Tyner arrived at Tyner's office at closing time 4 P.M. and was allowed to enter Tyner's office unsuspectedly alone. Tyner's wife then secretly let in her sister-in-law and a company safe man by another door who unlocked the safe whereupon Mrs. Tyner retrieved all of Tyner's official papers. Having bundled and packaged the papers Mrs. Tyner sent the papers by an African American messenger who had also entered Tyner's office by another door taking the papers to Tyner's residence. After her party had left by the other door Mrs. Tyner then walked out of Tyner's office alone and returned to Tyner's house. The head of the Post Office Bureau George Christiancy immediately discovered and informed Postmaster-General Payne of Mrs. Tyner taking Tyners papers from the safe. Payne sent two investigators to Tyner's house but Tyner and his wife refused to give the investigators Tyner's papers nor allow the investigators into Tyner's residence.

On April 22 1903 Assistant Attorney General Tyner was removed from office by Postmaster-General Payne. Four days later on April 26 Tyner and his wife denied any wrongdoing. Tyner stated that he had served his country faithfully and the officials at the Post Office had ""lost their heads"". Tyner stated he remained on as Assistant Attorney after March 9 to vindicate his honor. Mrs. Tyner stated that she and her husband had been labeled robbers by the Postal Department. Mrs. Tyner said that she had freely been allowed to go into Tyner's office room where the safe was located and nothing was done in secret. Mrs. Tyner said she returned papers in a box to the Postal Department that did not have any criminal evidence.

In mid-1903 Tyner was investigated for corruption in the Post Office by special prosecutor Charles J. Bonaparte and Fourth Assistant Postmaster General Joseph L. Bristow. Tyner was indicted three times for fraud and one count bribery. Also indicted was First Assistant Postmaster Perry S. Heath. President Roosevelt stated the postal investigation revealed a condition of ""gross corruption"" in their offices.   Allegations against Tyner and Heath ranged from gross negligence of office criminal collusion to actual participation in frauds bribery and financial profiteering.  Tyner was acquitted for lack of evidence since Tyner's wife had removed his papers from his office in April. Bristow's investigation resulted in 41 indictments against 31 persons connected to the postal frauds. Four postal officers and employees resigned while thirteen workers were removed from office.

42184,Pyrénées-Atlantiques,Culture,"These parts of the department that were part of Guyenne and Gascony and Béarn have a culture heavily influenced by the Basques but clearly different identities.

Both the Gascon Bearnese variant and Basque language are indigenous to the region in their respective districts. Gascon in turn is a dialect of Occitan formerly the main language of southern France. It is more closely related to Catalan than it is to French. Basque is a language isolate not related to any known language. Today French the sole official language of the French Republic is the predominant native language and is spoken by virtually all inhabitants.

Pyrénées-Atlantiques is also home to a number of professional sports teams including Aviron Bayonnais Biarritz Olympique Section Paloise (rugby) Élan Béarnais Pau-Orthez (basketball) and Pau FC (association football). The Pau Grand Prix an auto race first held in 1901 has hosted the World Touring Car Championship British Formula Three Formula 3 Euro Series and FIA European Formula 3 Championship.

733079,Doug Padgett,Life and career,"Born 20 July 1934 in Bradford Padgett had an elder brother Granville who was also a professional cricketer. He played for Idle Cricket Club in 1951. Also in 1951 he became the youngest player then to play first-class cricket for Yorkshire aged just 16 years and 320 days. Paul Jarvis broke his record in 1981.

After National Service Padgett was one of the first of a new generation of Yorkshire batsmen to cement his place in the Yorkshire first team. He scored more than 1000 runs in 1956 and in the County Championship-winning side of 1959 he was the leading batsman with more than 2000 runs. He usually batted at No 3 though he occasionally opened the innings.

In 1960 a tour by the South Africans widely perceived as weak led the England Test selectors to experiment with new batsmen and Padgett played in the fourth and fifth matches. He was not a great success and was one of a number of England players criticised in The Oval Test match for slow batting in the second innings.
He went to New Zealand the following winter on an extensive MCC tour but he was never picked again for England. Padgett failed to convert his innings into big scores albeit registering 50 one hundred and twenty nine times in his first-class career Padgett only reached the century mark on thirty two occasions. This counted against him when the England selectors considered his promotion to further international duty. However he remained a valued member of the Yorkshire side that won six further Championships across the 1960s. He scored more than 1000 runs in 12 seasons.

He retired from playing in 1971 much to the frustration of the new captain Geoffrey Boycott who relied on his counsel. Padgett then captained Yorkshire's second eleven becoming assistant then head coach.
He watched the teenage Michael Vaughan for ""about a quarter of an hour without saying a word"" before turning to the county's Cricket Development Manager and saying ""Sign him"".

644743,William Edward Petty Hartnell,Schoolmaster,"He was moderately successful at ranching but he preferred to do something else. On December 10 1833 he announced he was opening a school named ""El Seminario del Patrocinio de San Jose"" or ""Colegio de San Jose"" (for short) hoping to make a living as a schoolmaster. This school was financially supported by the Governor of Alta California José Figueroa. The focus of the school was to prepare students for university study although pupils as young as eight were admitted. Classes were initially held in Hartnell's house but later moved to other buildings on Rancho El Alisal. Although the school received praise it was forced to shut down in 1836 after the death of Governor Figueroa and when the Mexican government forced all Spaniards to leave California including the two Jesuit priests who taught the classes.

Following this Hartnell was appointed to several county posts by his former pupil-turned-governor Alvarado including tax collector treasurer and customs administrator. He also oversaw the secularization of the missions but had to resign that post due to threats from the rancheros  In 1841 he was granted Rancho Todos Santos y San Antonio by Alvarado.  He sold Rancho El Alisal to Alvarado in 1841 and moved with his family to Santa Barbara.  In 1844 he was also granted Rancho Cosumnes by Governor Manuel Micheltorena.

In February 1845 Governor Pío Pico ended all of Hartnell's government jobs in retaliation for Hartnell's dismissing of him as administrator of Mission San Luis Rey. However Hartnell's brother-in-law Pablo de la Guerra was able to secure him a job establishing a treasury in the city of San Francisco.

'''a.'''  Edmund's father Robert was the son of Edmund Waller (1536-1603) who was in turn the son of Robert Waller (1517–53) a scion of the Waller family of Groombridge Place Kent. A branch of this family settled firstly at Newport Pagnell Buckinghamshire and in the 17th century moved to Virginia where they became prominent in early Virginia affairs. Prominent members of this branch include Benjamin Waller Littleton Waller Tazewell and Edwin Waller.

'''b.'''  His descendant Rachel Waller considering the Breux family's connections with Barbados wrote in 1939 that: ""this probably gave rise to the assumption that she was not of pure European blood. In support of this theory we may compare the portrait of the poet with those of his descendants. In these latter the long face and aquiline lineaments of the poet have given way to round blunt features and curly black hair.""

169662,Yazid I,Setbacks,"During the caliphate of Yazid ibn Muawiya Muslims suffered several military setbacks. In AD 682 Yazid restored Uqba ibn Nafi as the governor of north Africa and Uqba won battles against the Berbers and Byzantines. Uqba then marched westward towards Tangier and then marched eastwards the Atlas Mountains.

With cavalry numbering about 300 he proceeded towards Biskra where he was ambushed by a Berber force. Uqba and all his men died fighting and the Berbers launched a counterattack and drove Muslims from north Africa. That was a major setback for the Muslims as they lost supremacy at sea and had to abandon the islands of Rhodes and Crete.

780197,CXAM radar,Introduction," at Brisbane Australia on 15 August 1941 carrying an early CXAM radar on her foremast.
The CXAM-1 antenna aboard  in November 1942.
 off New York City New York 21 August 1942 with CXAM-1 antenna visible top center.

The '''CXAM radar''' system was the first production radar system deployed on United States Navy ships operating in the mid-high VHF frequency band of 200 MHz. It followed several earlier prototype systems such as the NRL radar installed in April 1937 on the destroyer ; its successor the XAF installed in December 1938 on the battleship ; and the first RCA-designed system the CXZ installed in December 1938 or January 1939 on the battleship . Based on testing in January 1939 where the XAF was more reliable the US Navy ordered RCA to build six XAF-based units for deployment and then shortly thereafter ordered 14 more.

The first six units RCA produced (delivered in 1940) were denoted ""CXAM"" and were a fusion of XAF and CXZ technologies. These were installed on the battleship  the aircraft carrier  (in September 1940) and the heavy cruisers    and .  The next 14 units RCA produced (also delivered in 1940) were denoted ""CXAM-1"" and were slight improvements over the CXAM design. These were installed on the battleships ''Texas'' (in October 1941)    and ; on the aircraft carriers     and ; on the heavy cruiser ; on two light cruisers; and on the seaplane tender .

Radar detection range of aircraft depends on altitude size and number of aircraft. Surface ships are more difficult to detect due to ground clutter and require shorter ranges. The CXAM is listed (in U.S. Radar Operational Characteristics of Radar Classified by Tactical Application) as being able to detect single aircraft at 50 miles and to detect large ships at 14 miles. Other sources list CXAM detection range on aircraft out to 100 miles. ''Lexington''s CXAM-1 detected the incoming Japanese carrier aircraft strike at a range of 68 miles during the battle of the Coral Sea.

The US Army's first non-prototype radar system the SCR-270 radar was developed in parallel with the CXAM.

The US Navy's use of radar was an important advantage in World War II compared to the Imperial Japanese Navy's widespread lack of radar on its ships.

Several days before the surrender Queen Wilhelmina her family and the Dutch government left the country for the United Kingdom. Shortly after the German victory the Dutch government led by Prime Minister Dirk Jan de Geer was invited by the Germans to return to the country and form a pro-German puppet government as the Vichy government had agreed to do in France. De Geer wanted to accept this invitation but the Queen did not and dismissed De Geer in favour of Pieter Gerbrandy.

546268,Pavlo Tychyna,Work,"His initial work had strong connections to the symbolist literary movement but his style transformed a number of times during his long career and frequently aped the acceptable socialist realism. His first works exploded onto the avant-garde Ukrainian scene with their colorful imagery and dynamic rhythms. However as the Communist approach to artistic expression hardened and the role of a state-supported artist became more defined and restricted Tychyna's poetry shifted rather dramatically using clear pro-Communist political language including a famous ode to Joseph Stalin and the lyrics of the state anthem of the Ukrainian SSR. In 1933 the newspaper ''Pravda'' published his poem ""The Party leads"" in the Ukrainian language. Tychyna was often criticized by Ukrainian exiles for the praising of Communism in his work and co-option by the regime but recent scholarship has stressed his subtle distancing and mocking of Communist excesses and brutality through over-the-top suffusive praise.

424116,East Suffolk line,Miscellanea,"Two of the stations on the line had level crossings that were incorporated into the platforms.  At Saxmundham the original down platform (the platforms here were staggered rather than opposite each other) required extension for longer trains and rather than close the Chantry Road the platform acted as a gate and were swung across the railway when road access was required. A train hit the road gate in the early 1960s and the platform was replaced by more conventional gates. By this time the railway had become a secondary route and the longer platform was not required.

A similar arrangement was at Halesworth where the platforms were extended in 1887. Increasing road traffic in the 1950s resulted in a new road bridge being built to the north of the station. The level crossing was abolished in 1959 although the gates remained as part of the platform for some years.

The movable platform at Halesworth Station c. 2008

At Beccles there was an unusual draw bridge arrangement which allowed milk churns and barrows to be moved from the main platform to the island platform. This was installed in 1933 and was located at the south end of the station. When not in use the bridge formed part of the platform surface.

At Woodbridge there was long siding (referred to as a tramway) which ran alongside the East Suffolk line for  towards Melton. Serving a number of riverside industries and open until the 1950s it was notable as being worked by shunting horses rather than locomotives.

359142,Talia al Ghul,Publication history,"Talia al Ghul was created by writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Bob Brown. The character's creation and depiction was inspired by other works of fiction such as the 1969 James Bond film ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' and the Fu Manchu fiction. The character first appeared in ''Detective Comics'' #411 (May 1971). She is most commonly depicted as a romantic interest for Batman a villain or a combination of the two. Her father the leader of a worldwide criminal empire considered Batman the man most worthy to marry Talia and become his successor. Absent a spouse Talia was considered as an heir to her father and his organization. While Batman is uninterested in the criminal empire he has often demonstrated romantic feelings for Talia.

Talia has saved the life of Batman or helped him on numerous occasions. The majority of her criminal acts have been committed at the behest of her father and motivated by loyalty to her father rather than personal gain. She had been depicted as morally ambiguous or an antiheroic figure. Recent depictions have shown her to be more often an enemy of Batman and a supervillain in her own right such as leading the League of Assassins as part of the Secret Society of Super Villains and as the mastermind behind Leviathan.

IGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time List ranked Talia as #42. She was ranked 25th in ''Comics Buyer's Guide's'' ""100 Sexiest Women in Comics"" list.

195947,Scavenger,Animals,"Vultures eating the carcass of a red deer in Spain

Obligate scavenging is very rare in the animal kingdom due to the difficulty of finding enough carrion without expending too much energy. In vertebrates only vultures and possibly some pterosaurs are obligate scavengers as terrestrial soaring flyers are the only animals able to find enough carrion.

Well-known invertebrate scavengers of animal material include burying beetles and blowflies which are obligate scavengers and yellowjackets.

Most scavenging animals are facultative scavengers that gain most of their food through other methods especially predation. Many large carnivores that hunt regularly such as hyenas and jackals but also animals rarely thought of as scavengers such as African lions leopards and wolves will scavenge if given the chance. They may also use their size and ferocity to intimidate the original hunters (the cheetah is a notable exception). Almost all scavengers above insect size are predators and will hunt if not enough carrion is available as few ecosystems provide enough dead animals year-round to keep its scavengers fed on that alone. Scavenger wild dogs and crows frequently exploit roadkill.

Scavengers of dead plant material include termites that build nests in grasslands and then collect dead plant material for consumption within the nest. The interaction between scavenging animals and humans is seen today most commonly in suburban settings with animals such as opossums polecats and raccoons. In some African towns and villages scavenging from hyenas is also common.

In the prehistoric eras the ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' may have been an apex predator preying upon hadrosaurs ceratopsians and possibly juvenile sauropods although some experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a scavenger. The debate about whether ''Tyrannosaurus'' was an apex predator or scavenger was among the longest ongoing feud in paleontology; however most scientists now agree that ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' was an opportunistic carnivore acting mostly as a predator but scavenging when it could. Recent research also shows that while an adult Tyrannosaurus rex would energetically gain little though scavenging smaller theropods of approximately 500 kg may have potentially gained levels similar to that of hyenas though not enough for them to rely on scavenging.

Animals which consume feces such as dung beetles are referred to as coprovores. Animals that collect small particles of dead organic material of both animal and plant origin are referred to as detritivores.

332582,Charles Simic,Biography,"===Early years===
Dušan Simić was born in Belgrade. In his early childhood during World War II he and his family was forced to evacuate their home several times to escape indiscriminate bombing of Belgrade. Growing up as a child in war-torn Europe shaped much of his world-view Simic states. In an interview from the ''Cortland Review'' he said ""Being one of the millions of displaced persons made an impression on me. In addition to my own little story of bad luck I heard plenty of others. I'm still amazed by all the vileness and stupidity I witnessed in my life.""

Simic immigrated to the United States with his brother and mother in order to join his father in 1954 when he was sixteen. He grew up in Chicago. In 1961 he was drafted into the U.S. Army and in 1966 he earned his B.A. from New York University while working at night to cover the costs of tuition. He is professor emeritus of American literature and creative writing at the University of New Hampshire where he has taught since 1973 and lives on the shore of Bow Lake in Strafford New Hampshire.

===Career===
He began to make a name for himself in the early to mid-1970s as a literary minimalist writing terse imagistic poems. Critics have referred to Simic's poems as ""tightly constructed Chinese puzzle boxes"". He himself stated: ""Words make love on the page like flies in the summer heat and the poet is merely the bemused spectator."" 

Simic writes on such diverse topics as jazz art and philosophy. He is a translator essayist and philosopher opining on the current state of contemporary American poetry. He held the position of poetry editor of ''The Paris Review'' and was replaced by Dan Chiasson. He was elected to The American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1995 received the Academy Fellowship in 1998 and was elected a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets in 2000.

Simic was one of the judges for the 2007 Griffin Poetry Prize and continues to contribute poetry and prose to ''The New York Review of Books''. Simic received the US$100000 Wallace Stevens Award in 2007 from the Academy of American Poets. 

He was selected by James Billington Librarian of Congress to be the fifteenth Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress succeeding Donald Hall. In choosing Simic as the poet laureate Billington cited ""the rather stunning and original quality of his poetry"".

490051,Bruce E. Levine,Introduction,"

'''Bruce E. Levine''' PhD is a clinical psychologist often at odds with the mainstream of his profession (see critical psychology) in private practice in Cincinnati Ohio. He has been in practice for nearly three decades. Levine writes and speaks widely on how society culture politics and psychology intersect.

Levine's most recent book is ''Get Up Stand Up: Uniting Populists Energizing the Defeated and Battling the Corporate Elite'' (Chelsea Green Publishing 2011 ). It calls for a new kind of politics to help Americans overcome what Levine sees as political demoralization.

Published in 2007 ''Surviving America's Depression Epidemic: How to Find Morale Energy and Community in a World Gone Crazy'' (Chelsea Green Publishing) argues that by not seriously confronting posited societal sources of depression American mental health institutions have become part of the problem rather than the solution. The book provides an alternate approach that encompasses what Levine describes as the whole of our humanity society and culture and which redefines depression (as a problematic strategy to shut down pain) in a way that makes enduring transformation more likely.

Levine is also the author of ''Commonsense Rebellion: Taking Back Your Life from Drugs Shrinks Corporations and a World Gone Crazy'' (New York-London: Continuum 2003) a protest book.  The 26 alphabetically ordered chapters of ''Commonsense Rebellion'' detail Levine's contention that the high national rates of mental illness in the United States are really just natural reactions (e.g. discontent and disconnectedness) to the oppression of what he terms an ""institutional society"" which he argues causes many to break down psychologically.  An earlier edition was released in 2001 with the subtitle ''Debunking Psychiatry Confronting Society — An A to Z Guide to Rehumanizing Our Lives''.

Levine is a regular contributor to ''AlterNet ''( archive)'''' ''CounterPunch'' ''Z Magazine'' ''Truthout'' and  ''The Huffington Post'' and his articles have appeared in ''Adbusters'' ''The Ecologist'' and many other publications.

Levine is a member of MindFreedom International a group opposed to what they describe as coercive mental health treatment and on the Advisory Council of the International Society for Ethical Psychology and Psychiatry (ISEPP).

554516,Ron Fellows,NASCAR,"Fellows has had various stints in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Nationwide Series and Sprint Cup Series as a ""road course ringer"". He has 2 wins and 3 poles in the Camping World Truck Series winning twice at Watkins Glen. He has had even greater success in the NASCAR Nationwide Series where he has 4 wins and two poles in 6 starts. He was also the first non-American to win a NASCAR Nationwide Series event. As of November 22 2011 Fellows holds the record for most wins by a foreign-born driver in NASCAR's top three series (Sprint Cup Nationwide and Trucks) with six - four in Nationwide and two in Trucks.

Fellows made his NASCAR Cup series debut in 1995 driving the No. 68 Chevy. After he performed awfully during the race Fellows stepped down from Cup racing to drive a part-time stint in the Craftsman truck series. Fellows did not return to the Cup series until 1998 driving the No. 96 Chevy. Starting second alongside Jeff Gordon Fellows had a promising race until he broke down from axle issues on lap 87. He finished 42nd. He also ran an oval race in the same car-at Loudon which happens to be his single race he's run that is not a road course. He finished 36th after starting dead last.

Fellows won his first Busch series event on June 28 1998 leading the most laps during the 1998 Lysol 200. After polesitter Boris Said spun on lap 1 Fellows took the lead and led 54 of 82 laps. Fellows held off Michael McLaughlin to win the race. In 1999 Fellows nearly repeated the win but got passed by hotshot Dale Earnhardt Jr. on the final lap.

In August 1999 Fellows had his career-best finish at Watkins Glen driving the No. 87 Chevy for Joe Nemechek. In his only scheduled NASCAR Cup series race for 1999 for the Frontier at the Glen Fellows led 3 laps but was beaten by Jeff Gordon on the final restart. Ron Fellows returned to the No. 87 in 2001 driving both road courses. A promising run at Sears Point Raceway in which he led the most laps Fellows finished 38th after crashing with 14 laps to go. He led 3 laps at Watkins Glen during the Global Crossing at the Glen but finished 42nd after breaking his brakes on lap 30 of 90.

In 2000 Fellows was in talk with Dale Earnhardt about driving for Dale Earnhardt Inc. full-time after 2001. When it appeared that the full-time deal was sealed up Earnhardt was killed during the 2001 Daytona 500 which left the deal invalid. In 2003 however Fellows was remembered by Ty Norris the DEI co-owner and he was hired for the road races to drive the No. 1 car.

In 2003 at Infineon during the Dodge/Save Mart 350 Fellows had his career's nearest-miss. Fellows started third and took advantage of a battle between Richard Childress Racing teammates Robby Gordon and Kevin Harvick to take the lead. Fellows led a lot of laps and controlled the race with less than 70 laps to go. However Fellows had his sure-win end for good after being called into pit road just after an untimely caution came out with 38 laps to go. Restarting 31st Fellows finished 7th. Though Fellows has finished second twice at the Glen Fellows stated in 2006 and 2013 that the 2003 Dodge Save-Mart 350 was how closest he had been to winning because he was dominant at Sonoma while the Watkins Glen finishes is when he lacked the proper speed.

In 2004 Fellows had one of his greatest performances. Because qualifying was cancelled due to rain the lineup for the Watkins Glen event was decided by owner-points. Fellows started 43rd and finished second behind winner Tony Stewart. Fellows did challenge Stewart on the final restart but all of his speed was worn out by his charge through the field.

In 2005 and 2006 Fellows drove the No. 32 car for Cal Wells and PPI Motorsports at Infineon and Watkins Glen. After starting 43rd at Sonoma he finished 8th. In 2006 Fellows had originally finished 10th during the AMD at the Glen but was penalized 30 seconds hours after the race ended for having illegally made passes through the ""bus stop"". The Tide team later closed up shop after the year was over throwing Fellows out of his part-time ride.

In 2007 Fellows joined Hall of Fame Racing as driver for the road races. In a similar performance to the 2003 Infineon race Fellows led a bit of the race after passing in a 3-wide move and lost the lead after having to pit during a caution. Fellows finished 15th. After starting 26th at Watkins Glen Fellows moved up to fourth. Fellows probably would have had a shot at the win had he not gotten a speeding on pit road penalty on lap 55 and had to restart 40th. But in a challenging rough drive through the field Fellows finished 4th.

During 2006 and 2007 Fellows drove the No. 33 Busch series car for Kevin Harvick Incorporated driving the road course races in Mexico City Montreal and Watkins Glen. In 2006 Fellows led 1 lap in Mexico City but finished 33rd after blowing a radiator with less than 10 laps to go. Fellows picked up a top ten at Watkins Glen finishing 9th.

In 2007 Fellows renewed his deal for one more year to drive for Kevin Harvick Inc. in the No. 33 for the NBS road course events. In Mexico Fellows didn't have a promising race finishing 33rd after blowing an engine with less than 15 laps to go.

At the first NBS race at Montreal he drove a good race starting 3rd in the No. 33 Camping World.com car. After spinning out with less than 9 laps to go Fellows mounted his best drive of the race during the final green-white-checkered finish attempt; he drove from 14th place to 4th place in two laps. His boss Kevin Harvick ended up winning the race because of Robby Gordon and rookie Marcos Ambrose's altercation. The next week at Watkins Glen he controlled the race early leading 11 laps but ended up 24th after tangling with fellow road ringer Scott Pruett on the final lap.

In 2008 Fellows only raced in 1 event driving his first race for JR Motorsports. Fellows in his only start of 2008 won a rain-shortened NAPA Auto Parts 200 at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in the No. 5 car at Montreal. He won after Marcos Ambrose was black-flagged for slipping across the soaked pit road too fast just before the red flag flew. This race made history as the first points paying race to be run on Goodyear rain tires. NASCAR races are generally red flagged for rain. This victory marked Ron's fourth NASCAR Nationwide series win all coming on road courses. This also tied him for first in the Nationwide Series for most road course wins. He is tied with Terry Labonte with 4. Fellows was very emotional about his win because his lifelong childhood dream was to win a professional car race at Montreal since his childhood hero Gilles Villeneuve raced at the track when he watched from the stadium. As a result of his big win Fellows was given the No. 5 JR Motorsports crew for a multi-year deal. He drove for JR Motorsports through 2009 and 2010 for the road course races. Fellows didn't have any promising races in 2009 but came back to the No. 88 team in 2010 to finish second at Road America. 
2011 Nationwide car at Road America
Fellows returned to JR Motorsports in 2011 for the road course races driving the #7 AER car. He was in contention to win the Bucyrus 200 at Road America. He took the lead from Justin Allgaier who had run out of fuel previously passing Reed Sorenson in the process. However NASCAR ruled that Fellows had passed both drivers under the caution flag way too fast. Believing that Sorenson slowed due to also being out of fuel Fellows drove past them at nearly race speed until he was leading the caution to the pace lap though NASCAR rules stipulate that a driver must maintain reasonable speed while under the caution flag (Speeding is not reasonable caution speed anymore). As a result Fellows was relegated to second place post-race handing the win to Sorenson. To this day Fellows maintains that he should have won the race.

During 2010 and 2011 Fellows drove the No. 36 car for Tommy Baldwin Racing in the Cup series. After running most of the 2010 Heluva Good at the Glen in the top ten Fellows suffered a blown engine and finished 40th. In 2011 Fellows only ran at Watkins Glen driving the No. 36 Golden Corral car for Baldwin. Fellows wasn't much of a factor in the race. While running 25th on the final lap Fellows got tangled in a final-lap crash involving David Ragan and David Reutimann crashing head-on into a barrier in the esses. He finished 30th.

The next year Fellows couldn't land a ride for the Sprint Cup series but ran the Nationwide Series road course races for JR Motorsports. Fellows led 4 laps at Road America and finished 3rd. He finished 5th at Watkins Glen and 5th in Montreal.

Fellows returned to the Cup series in 2013. He drove the No. 33 car for Circle Sport Racing. His best finish was at Infineon Raceway when he finished 22nd.

96476,Chine-collé,Glue,"There is some variation in adhesives used for ''Chine-collé''. Some artists are reported to use a dusting of flour right before pressing rather than paste. Some have tried using no adhesive at all simply relying on the high pressure of the printing press and properties of the paper (fibers sizing) to fuse the papers together similar to paper-making; however this method may be variable and unreliable.  More recently some artists have turned to adhesives such as PVA glue or gel medium rather than paste.

In traditional paste-making for ''Chine-collé'' wheat or rice starch is separated from gluten and other things in wheat or rice flour. Pure starch is then cooked with distilled water to form a congealed gel. Finally the gel is passed through a fine sieve such as a piece of silk to form the paste. Starch-based pastes are considered archival and are sometimes used in other paper-based applications such as book binding book repair and collage.

172842,Soil test,Plant nutrition,"In agriculture a '''soil test''' commonly refers to the analysis of a soil sample to determine nutrient content composition and other characteristics such as the acidity or pH level. A soil test can determine fertility or the expected growth potential of the soil which indicates nutrient deficiencies potential toxicities from excessive fertility and inhibitions from the presence of non-essential trace minerals. The test is used to mimic the function of roots to assimilate minerals.  The expected rate of growth is modeled by the Law of the Maximum.

Labs such as those at Iowa State and Colorado State University recommend that a soil test contains 10-20 sample points for every   of field. Tap water or chemicals can change the composition of the soil and may need to be tested separately. As soil nutrients vary with depth and soil components change with time the depth and timing of a sample may also affect results.

Composite sampling can be performed by combining soil from several locations prior to analysis. This is a common procedure but should be used judiciously to avoid skewing results. This procedure must be done so that government sampling requirements are met. A reference map should be created to record the location and quantity of field samples in order to properly interpret test results.

=== Storage handling and moving ===
Soil chemistry changes over time as biological and chemical processes break down or combine compounds over time. These processes change once the soil is removed from its natural ecosystem (flora and fauna that penetrate the sampled area) and environment (temperature moisture and solar light/radiation cycles). As a result the chemical composition analysis accuracy can be improved if the soil is analysed soon after its extraction — usually within a relative time period of 24 hours. The chemical changes in the soil can be slowed during storage and transportation by freezing it. Air drying can also preserve the soil sample for many months.

===Soil testing===
Soil testing is often performed by commercial labs that offer a variety of tests targeting groups of compounds and minerals. The advantages associated with local lab is that they are familiar with the chemistry of the soil in the area where the sample was taken. This enables technicians to recommend the tests that are most likely to reveal useful information.

Soil testing in progress
Laboratory tests often check for plant nutrients in three categories:
* Major nutrients: nitrogen (N) phosphorus (P) and potassium (K)
* Secondary nutrients: sulfur calcium magnesium
* Minor nutrients: iron manganese copper zinc boron molybdenum chlorine

Do-it-yourself kits usually only test for the three ""major nutrients"" and for soil acidity or pH level. Do-it-yourself kits are often sold at farming cooperatives university labs private labs and some hardware and gardening stores. Electrical meters that measure pH water content and sometimes nutrient content of the soil are also available at many hardware stores. Laboratory tests are more accurate than tests with do-it-yourself kits and electrical meters. Here is an example  soil sample report from one laboratory.

Soil testing is used to facilitate fertilizer composition and dosage selection for land employed in both agricultural and horticultural industries.

Prepaid mail-in kits for soil and ground water testing are available to facilitate the packaging and delivery of samples to a laboratory. Similarly in 2004 laboratories began providing fertilizer recommendations along with the soil composition report.

Lab tests are more accurate though both types are useful. In addition lab tests frequently include professional interpretation of results and recommendations. Always refer to all proviso statements included in a lab report as they may outline any anomalies exceptions and shortcomings in the sampling and/or analytical process/results.

Some laboratories analyze for all 13 mineral nutrients and a dozen non-essential potentially toxic minerals utilizing the ""universal soil extractant"" (ammonium bicarbonate DTPA).

298476,Port-Royal National Historic Site,Original settlement of Port-Royal (1605–13),"Typical 17th century uniform at Port-Royal
Port-Royal was founded after the French nobleman Pierre Du Gua de Monts who spent a disastrous winter in Île-Saint-Croix. He was accompanied by Samuel de Champlain Louis Hébert and Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt et de Saint-Just.  They decided to move their settlement to the north shore of present-day Annapolis Basin a sheltered bay on the south shore of the Bay of Fundy which had been recorded by Champlain earlier in the spring of 1605 during a coastal reconnaissance. Champlain would note in his journals that the bay was of impressive size; he believed it an adequate anchorage for several hundred ships of the French Royal Fleet if ever necessary. As such he would name the basin ""Port-Royal"" the Royal Port; this was for many years the name of both the body of water and the subsequent French and Acadian settlements in that region.  Poutrincourt asked King Henri IV to become the owner of the Seigneurie which encompassed the settlement.

Nestled against the North Mountain range they set about constructing a log stockade fortification called a ""habitation.""  With assistance from members of the Mi'kmaq Nation and a local chief named Membertou coupled with the more temperate climate of the fertile Annapolis Valley the settlement prospered.

Mindful of the disastrous winter of 1603–04 at the Île-Saint-Croix settlement Champlain established ''l'Ordre de Bon Temps'' (''the Order of Good Cheer'') as a social club ostensibly to promote better nutrition and to get settlers through the winter of 1606–07.  Supper every few days became a feast with a festive air supplemented by performances and alcohol and was primarily attended by the prominent men of the colony and their Mi'kmaq neighbours while the Mi'kmaq women children and poorer settlers looked on and were offered scraps. Marc Lescarbot's ""The Theatre of Neptune in New France"" the first work of theater written and performed in North America was performed on November 14 1606. It was arguably the catalyst for the Order of Good Cheer.

In 1607 Dugua had his fur trade monopoly revoked by the Government of France forcing settlers to return to France that fall. The Habitation was left in the care of Membertou and the local Mi'kmaq until 1610 when Sieur de Poutrincourt another French nobleman returned with a small expedition to ''Port-Royal''.  Poutrincourt converted Membertou and local Mi'kmaq to Catholicism hoping to gain financial assistance from the government. As a result Jesuits became financial partners with Poutrincourt although this caused division within the community.

In May 1613 the Jesuits moved on to the Penobscot River valley and in July the settlement was attacked by Samuel Argall of Virginia.  Argall returned in November that same year and burned the Habitation to the ground while settlers were away nearby.  Poutrincourt returned from France in spring 1614 to find ''Port-Royal'' in ruins and settlers living with the Mi'kmaq.  Poutrincourt then gave his holdings to his son and returned to France.  Poutrincourt's son bequeathed the settlement to Charles de Saint-Étienne de la Tour upon his own death in 1623.

Port Royal and Annapolis Basin 1609
Port-Royal from Samuel de Champlain's diagram circa 1612.

Port-Royal was the capital of Acadia from 1605 to 1710. Initially Port-Royal was located on the north shore of the Annapolis Basin in the present-day community of Port Royal (note the Anglophone spelling) which is the site of the replica reconstruction of the original Habitation at Port-Royal. After its destruction by raiders from Virginia in 1613 Port-Royal was re-established on the south bank of the river  upstream. The British renamed Port-Royal at this new location as Annapolis Royal following their conquest of Acadia in 1710.

Port-Royal was founded by Pierre Dugua Sieur de Mons and Samuel de Champlain in 1605. The settlement was the first permanent European settlement north of St. Augustine Florida. (Two years later the English made their first permanent settlement in Jamestown Virginia.)  Approximately seventy-five years after Port-Royal was founded Acadians spread out from the capital to found the other major Acadian settlements established before the Expulsion of the Acadians: Grand-Pré Chignecto Cobequid and Pisiguit.

In the 150 years prior to the founding of Halifax in 1749 Port-Royal/Annapolis Royal was the capital of Acadia and later Nova Scotia for most decades.  During that time the British made six attempts to conquer Acadia by attacking the capital at Port-Royal (present day Annapolis Royal Nova Scotia. They finally defeated the French in 1710 following the Siege of Port-Royal. Over the following fifty years the French and their allies made six unsuccessful military attempts to regain the capital. Including a raid by Americans in the American Revolution Port-Royal (at present-day Annapolis Royal) faced a total of thirteen attacks more than any other place in North America.

Portrait of Captain Samuel Argall
Pierre Dugua Sieur de Monts built the Habitation at Port-Royal in 1605 as a replacement for his initial attempt at colonizing Saint Croix Island in the Saint Croix River on the boundary between present-day Maine and New Brunswick. The trading monopoly of de Monts was cancelled in 1607 and most of the French settlers returned to France although some remained with the natives. Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt et de Saint-Just led a second expedition to Port-Royal in 1610.

Port-Royal was the site of a number of North American firsts: the first resident surgeon; first continuing church services; first social club (named the ""Order of Good Cheer""); creation of the first library; first French theatrical performance (titled ''Neptune''); first apothecary; and first weekly Bible class. The author of ''Neptune'' Marc Lescarbot wrote a popular history of his time in New France entitled ''Histoire de la Nouvelle-France'' (1609).

===Battle of Port Royal (1613)===
Almost ten years later the Admiral of Virginia Samuel Argall led an English invasion force from Virginia to attack Acadia.  He began with the Saint-Saveur mission (Mount Desert Island Maine) and then St. Croix Island.  In October 1613 Argall surprised the settlers at Port-Royal and sacked every building.
The battle destroyed the Habitation but it did not wipe out the colony.  Biencourt and his men remained in the area of Port-Royal (present day Port Royal Nova Scotia). A mill upstream at present day Lequille Nova Scotia remained along with settlers who went into hiding during the battle. (At this time future Governor Charles de Saint-Étienne de la Tour migrated from Port-Royal to establish himself at both Cap de Sable (present-day Port La Tour Nova Scotia) and Saint John New Brunswick.

2692,Church of England,Membership,"Official figures from 2005 showed there were 25 million baptised Anglicans in England and Wales. Due to its status as the established church in general anyone may be married have their children baptised or their funeral in their local parish church regardless of whether they are baptised or regular churchgoers.

Between 1890 and 2001 churchgoing in the United Kingdom declined steadily. In the years 1968 to 1999 Anglican Sunday church attendances almost halved from 3.5 per cent of the population to 1.9 per cent. By the year 2014 Sunday church attendances had declined further to 1.4 per cent of the population. One study published in 2008 suggested that if current trends were to continue Sunday attendances could fall to 350000 in 2030 and just 87800 in 2050.

In 2011 the Church of England published statistics showing 1.7 million people attending at least one of its services each month a level maintained since the turn of the millennium; approximately one million participating each Sunday and three million taking part in a Church of England service on Christmas Day or Christmas Eve. The church also claimed that 30% attend Sunday worship at least once a year; more than 40% attend a wedding in their local church and still more attend a funeral there. Nationally the Church of England baptises one child in ten (2011). In 2015 the church's statistics showed that 2.6 million people attended a special Advent service 2.4 million attended a Christmas service 1.3 million attended an Easter service and 980000 attended service during an average week.

The Church of England has 18000 active ordained clergy and 10000 licensed lay ministers. In 2009 491 people were recommended for ordination training maintaining the level at the turn of the millennium and 564 new clergy (266 women and 298 men) were ordained. More than half of those ordained (193 men and 116 women) were appointed to full-time paid ministry. In 2011 504 new clergy were ordained including 264 to paid ministry and 349 lay readers were admitted to ministry; and the mode age-range of those recommended for ordination training had remained 40–49 since 1999.

394854,Steady state,Introduction,"

In systems theory a system or a process is in a '''steady state''' if the variables (called state variables) which define the behavior of the system or the process are unchanging in time. In continuous time this means that for those properties ''p'' of the system the partial derivative with respect to time is zero and remains so:

: 
In discrete time it means that the first difference of each property is zero and remains so:
:
The concept of a steady state has relevance in many fields in particular thermodynamics economics and engineering.  If a system is in a steady state then the recently observed behavior of the system will continue into the future. In stochastic systems the probabilities that various states will be repeated will remain constant. See for example Linear difference equation#Conversion to homogeneous form for the derivation of the steady state.

In many systems a steady state is not achieved until some time after the system is started or initiated. This initial situation is often identified as a transient state start-up or warm-up period. For example while the flow of fluid through a tube or electricity through a network could be in a steady state because there is a constant flow of fluid or electricity a tank being drained or filled with fluid is a system in transient state because its volume of fluid changes with time. 

Often a steady state is approached asymptotically. An unstable system is one that diverges from the steady state. See for example Linear difference equation#Stability.

In chemistry a steady state is a more general situation than dynamic equilibrium. While a dynamic equilibrium occurs when two or more reversible processes occur at the same rate and such a system can be said to be in a steady state a system that is in a steady state may not necessarily be in a state of dynamic equilibrium because some of the processes involved are not reversible.

627311,Ion Moța,Biography,"Son of the nationalist Orthodox priest Ioan Moța who edited a journal called ''Liberty'' Ion I. Moța studied law at University of Paris (1920-1921) the University of Cluj University of Iași and University of Grenoble. His thesis finished in 1932 at the University of Grenoble was entitled ""Juridical Security in the Community of Nations."" 

At Cluj he founded Acțiunea Românească (""Romanian Action"") a nationalist group inspired by Charles Maurras' Action Française. This organization fused with A. C. Cuza's National-Christian Defense League in 1925. Moța met Corneliu Zelea Codreanu at a meeting of antisemitic students in August 1923. The two formed a plan to assassinate Romanian politicians and leaders of Romanian Jewry seen as traitors and corruptors of Romanian national life. They were arrested in Bucharest on 8 October 1923 and sent to Văcărești prison. Acquitted in March 1924 Moța shot Vernichescu the member of their conspiracy who betrayed it to the authorities seven times (but not fatally). He spent two months in Galata prison before being acquitted and released on 29 September 1924. 

Codreanu made Moța leader of ''Frăția de Cruce'' a group of peasants and students who would fight for nationalistic renewal (founded on 6 May 1924). Moța attended the World Anti-Semitic Congress in September 1925; upon the founding of the Iron Guard (the ''Legion of the Archangel Michael'') on 24 June 1927 he became deputy Captain to Codreanu.

Ion Moța represented the Legion at the 1934 Fascist International meeting in Montreux. He was vice-president of the Iron Guard political creation the ''Everything for the Country Party''. From 1934 through 1936 he served as a correspondent for ''Welt-Dienst'' / ''World-Service'' an anti-Jewish publication founded by Ulrich Fleischhauer in Erfurt Germany. Fleischhauer was a staunch believer in the veracity of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and appeared as an ""expert witness"" for the pro-Nazis at the famous Berne Trial.

In late 1936 Moța formed a Legionary unit to fight against the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. He and Vasile Marin (another prominent Legionary) were killed on the Madrid Front on the same day of fighting (13 January 1937). Their funerals in Bucharest (13 February 1937) were an immense and orderly procession (''see Funerals of Ion Moța and Vasile Marin'') attended by the Ministers of Nazi Germany Fascist Italy and Francisco Franco's Spain representatives of Portugal the Japan of the early Shōwa period and delegates of the Polish Patriotic Youth.

On the commemoration of the deaths of Moța and Marin 13 January 1938 Codreanu created a special order in the ranks of the Legionary units: the Moța-Marin Corps under the direction of Alexandru Cantacuzino. The members of this elite corps had ''Ready to Die'' as their slogan.

A monument was erected at Majadahonda on 13 September 1970 with support of Franco's government.

216822,Rubbery Figures,Fast Forward's ''Rubbery Figures'',"
Fast Forward included ''Rubbery Figures'' during its 1980s run lasting until 1990. It was during its appearance on ''Fast Forward'' that ''Rubbery Figures'' acquired so many of its characters.

=== Characters ===

==== Australian politicians ====

Like shows such as ''Spitting Image'' or ''Hurra Deutschland'' the primary characters of ''Rubbery Figures'' were politicians native to the program's country (i.e. Australia). The ''Rubbery Figures'' political characters included:

*'''Bob Hawke''' - portrayed as a self-centred power-hungry opportunist
*'''Paul Keating''' - depicted as Hawke's down-to-earth but ambitious crony
*'''Andrew Peacock''' - John Howard's main competition for the Liberal Party leadership portrayed as vain and snobbish
*'''John Howard''' - depicted as an irritating nerdy loser
*'''John Elliott''' - depicted as a big-nosed foul-mouthed drunkard

==== International politicians ====

''Rubbery Figures'' also satirised prominent world politicians of the time among them were:

*'''Margaret Thatcher''' - the then-Prime Minister of the United Kingdom who was depicted as an eccentric profiteer eager to appeal to the Australian government
*'''Ronald Reagan''' - the then-President of the United States who was portrayed as a lumberjack making decisions based on the horoscope or guesswork and intent on keeping his nuclear weapons program a secret
*'''Mikhail Gorbachev''' - former Premier of the Soviet Union who was depicted as an easygoing liberal who was always giving himself time off
*'''Muammar al-Gaddafi''' - the ruler of Libya whose puppet was permanently impaled by a missile with the letters ''""USA""'' painted on one side

Between 1896 and 1925 the title was awarded to the winner of Svenska Mästerskapet a stand-alone cup tournament. No club were given the title between 1926 and 1930 even though the first-tier league Allsvenskan was played. In 1931 the title was reinstated and awarded to the winner of Allsvenskan. Between 1982 and 1990 a play-off in cup format was held at the end of the league season to decide the champions. After the play-off format in 1991 and 1992 the title was decided by the winner of Mästerskapsserien an additional league after the end of Allsvenskan. Since the 1993 season the title has once again been awarded to the winner of Allsvenskan.

646747,Irreducible component,Introduction,"In mathematics and specifically in algebraic geometry the concept of '''irreducible component''' is used to make formal the idea that a set such as defined by the equation

:''XY'' = 0

is the union of the two lines

:''X'' = 0

and 

:''Y'' = 0.
Thus an algebraic set is '''irreducible''' if it is not the union of two proper algebraic subsets. It is a fundamental theorem of classical algebraic geometry that every algebraic set is the union of a finite number of irreducible algebraic subsets (varieties) and that this decomposition is unique if one removes those subsets that are contained in another one. The elements of this unique decomposition are called '''irreducible components'''.

This notion may be reformulated in topological terms using Zariski topology for which the closed sets are the subvarieties: an algebraic set is irreducible if it is not the union of two proper subsets that are closed for Zariski topology. This allows a generalization in topology and through it to general schemes for which the above property of finite decomposition is not necessarily true.

547143,British Rail Class 320,Operations,"The units were originally intended to operate on the Argyle Line but mainly because the platform monitors on the Argyle Line stations did not line up with the driver cabs the units had always been restricted to the North Clyde route although they were occasionally used for VIP trips from the high-level platforms of Glasgow Central when they were the newest EMU stock in the SPT fleet. The problem was resolved in 2011 and the units began entering service to replace the final Class 334 units from the Argyle Line. From December 2016 Class 320s have started to operate on the Cathcart/Newton lines from Glasgow Central High Level replacing some 314s which are cascading to Inverclyde

Like all SPT rolling stock of the period the Class 320s were painted in orange/black livery until 1997 when the carmine/cream livery was progressively phased in. Between 2002 and 2004 the Class 320 fleet were given a major interior refurbishment with new seat covers floor coverings improved interior saloon lighting diffusers and electronic and audible destination information systems installed. The units were given a revised SPT carmine & cream livery upon its refurbishment the most noticeable being the passenger doors being all cream.

In September 2008 the Scottish Government's agency Transport Scotland announced that all ''ScotRail'' trains would be eventually repainted in a new blue livery with white Saltire markings on the carriage ends. Relivery of the fleet began in February 2011 when the units are taken for their refurbishment. All Class 320 units are now in saltire livery.

417160,People's Palace Glasgow,Early history,"At the time the East End of Glasgow was one of the most unhealthy and overcrowded parts of the city and the People's Palace was intended to provide a cultural centre for the people. It was designed by the City Engineer Alexander B. McDonald. At the opening ceremony Lord Rosebery stated: ""A palace of pleasure and imagination around which the people may place their affections and which may give them a home on which their memory may rest"". He declared the building ""Open to the people for ever and ever"".

==Features==    
Originally the ground floor of the building provided reading and recreation rooms with a museum on the first floor and a picture gallery on the top floor. Since the 1940s it has been the museum of social history for the city of Glasgow and tells the story of the people and the city from 1750 to the present day. The collections and displays reflect the changing face of the city and the different experiences of Glaswegians at home work and leisure. Current displays (as of March 2009) include  glimpses of typical Glasgow history such as life in a ""single end"" (a one-room tenement home) going to ""The Steamie"" (the communal laundry) nights out at ""The Dancing"" in the famous Barrowland Ballroom and trips ""Doon The Watter"" (down the Firth of Clyde) on steamers such as the Waverley. The palace is also home to renowned Scottish Socialist John MacLean's campaign desk which can be found on the first floor.

==Closing== 
The building was closed for almost two years to allow restoration work to be carried out with the re-opening being timed to coincide with the 100-year anniversary of its first opening in 1898; this is recorded on a plaque mounted just inside the main entrance. Renovations extended to include the Winter Gardens to the rear of the building where the glasshouse was extensively restored and reglazed and the gardens tidied.

628201,Meissen porcelain,Tableware patterns,"A Meissen ''Zwiebelmuster'' dinner service
Böttger early foresaw the production of tableware and the first services were made in the 1720s.  Initial services were plain but Kaendler soon introduced matching decorations.  Kaendler also produced the 1745 ""New Cutout"" pattern characterized by a wavy edge cut.

The famous Swan Service (''Schwanenservice'') was made in 1737-43 for the manufactory's director Count Heinrich von Brühl; It eventually numbered more than a thousand pieces.  At the end of World War II the pieces of the Swan Service were scattered amongst collectors and museums.  Yet with the moulds still available the pattern continues to be made today.
Plate from the Swan Service
The Blue Onion pattern has been in production for close to three centuries.  It was basically designed by Höroldt in 1739 and is probably inspired by a Chinese bowl from the Kangxi period.  Widely popular the pattern has been copied extensively by over sixty companies; some of those competitors have even used the word ''Meissen'' as a marking. But the pattern became so popular and widespread that the German Supreme Court in 1926 ruled that the term ''Meissen Zwiebelmuster'' (""Meissen Onion Pattern"" only in English have the pomegranates depicted ever been likened to onions. A more precise term would have been ""Meissen Hyacinth Pattern"") was in the public domain.

A series of ""Court Dragon"" and ""Red Dragon"" tableware patterns features Chinese dragons generally in underglaze red with gilt details flying around the rim of the plate and with a medallion in the center of the cavetto.  A version of this pattern was used in Hitler's ''Kehlsteinhaus'' retreat.

Other popular patterns still in production include the ''Purple Rose'' pattern and the ''Vine-leaf'' pattern.

Perhaps his crowning piece of philanthropy was giving away his own palatial residence in Kottaiyur to found the Women's college. Rajaji has remarked ""Dr. Alagappa Chettiar had given away freely. Students should develop that quality namely giving money earned for charity. Here is a book of life and students can learn from him how one can give to good cause cultivate courage and emulate the spirit of Dr. Alagappa Chettiar"".

248763,1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens,Mudslides flow downstream,"Mudline next to Muddy River from the 1980 lahars
The hot exploding material also broke apart and melted nearly all of the mountain's glaciers along with most of the overlying snow. As in many previous St. Helens' eruptions this created huge lahars (volcanic mudflows) and muddy floods that affected three of the four stream drainage systems on the mountain and which started to move as early as 8:50 a.m. Lahars travelled as fast as  while still high on the volcano but progressively slowed to about  on the flatter and wider parts of rivers. Mudflows from the southern and eastern flanks had the consistency of wet concrete as they raced down Muddy River Pine Creek and Smith Creek to their confluence at the Lewis River. Bridges were taken out at the mouth of Pine Creek and the head of Swift Reservoir which rose  by noon to accommodate the nearly  of additional water mud and debris.

Glacier and snow melt mixed with tephra on the volcano's northeast slope to create much larger lahars. These mudflows traveled down the north and south forks of the Toutle River and joined at the confluence of the Toutle forks and the Cowlitz River near Castle Rock Washington at 1:00 p.m. Ninety minutes after the eruption the first mudflow had moved  upstream where observers at Weyerhaeuser's Camp Baker saw a  wall of muddy water and debris pass. Near the confluence of the Toutle's north and south forks at Silver Lake a record flood stage of  was recorded.

A large but slower-moving mudflow with a mortar-like consistency was mobilized in early afternoon at the head of the Toutle River north fork. By 2:30 p.m. the massive mudflow had destroyed Camp Baker and in the following hours seven bridges were carried away. Part of the flow backed up for  soon after entering the Cowlitz River but most continued downstream. After traveling  further an estimated  of material were injected into the Columbia River reducing the river's depth by  for a  stretch. The resulting  river depth temporarily closed the busy channel to ocean-going freighters costing Portland Oregon an estimated five million US dollars. Ultimately more than  of sediment were dumped along the lower Cowlitz and Columbia Rivers.

419209,Horncastle Canal,Operation,"The weir and gauging station at Tattershall. Gibsons Cut turned off to the left behind the green box.
The formal opening of the canal was on 17 September 1802 and the day was declared to be a public holiday in Horncastle so that everyone could celebrate. Boats were decked with bunting and flags a band played ""rousing tunes"" and the navvies were given free food and beer on boats in both the north and south basins.

Water levels in the canal were controlled by a sluice or staunch near the point at which the River Bain joined the River Waring. A new cut called the South Ings Drain which ran from below the sluice to join the old course of the River Bain near Thornton was made under the terms of the Horncastle Enclosure Award in 1805.  A cottage was erected next to the sluice to house the Staunchkeeper as adjustment of the sluice was vital in times of drought or flood.

Tolls were collected but for the first ten years were used to pay back the mortgage taken out in 1800 and it was not until 1813 that the first dividend was paid. Dividends were then paid every year as profits gradually increased. In the early 1850s the canal carried around 9710 tons of coal to Horncastle and around 5420 tons of goods including corn and wool in the other direction.

===Decline===
The remains of Gibsons Cut near its junction with the Dogdyke branch at Tattershall
In 1848 the Great Northern Railway opened a line from Lincoln to Boston and built a coal wharf at Dogdyke in 1851. This resulted in increased traffic on the canal but a branch line from Kirkstead to Horncastle via Woodhall Spa was opened in 1854 in direct competition to the canal after which decline was rapid with the last dividend being paid in 1873. Against this trend a short cut known as the Tumby Cut was built in 1876.

In 1888 the Board of Trade enquired about the status of the Company and Lindsey County Council suggested that it should be abandoned. The secretary sold Kirkby Watermill which had been used as the company workshops to raise some capital with which to clear debts and notified the Board that the canal was effectively defunct. It was officially abandoned on 23 September 1889 but sand and gravel continued to be transported from Kirkby on Bain for another ten years while the lower reaches of the canal remained in use until 1910 with boats taking coal from Goole to the Coningsby wharf of Laythorpe and Son Coal Merchants.

===Restoration===
There have been several suggestions that the canal should be restored. The first was made in 1975 by the Lincolnshire Branch of the Inland Waterways Association who recognised that the volume of pleasure traffic on the River Witham would need to increase before the scheme would be viable. In 1986 they prepared a more serious report which concentrated on Gibson's Cut but also looked at complete restoration in more general terms. From 1989 the Horncastle and Tattershall Conningsby Canal Heritage group (HATCH) began working on plans for restoration which were presented at a public meeting held on 18 November 2003. The meeting agreed that funds should be raised to finance a proper feasibility study. Restoration plans are now supported by Lincolnshire County Council.

+USS ''Silversides'' (SS-236)






'''USS ''Silversides'' (SS/AGSS-236)''' is a ''Gato''-class submarine the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the silversides a small fish marked with a silvery stripe along each side of its body.  Her keel was laid down on 4 November 1940 by the Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo California. She was launched on 26 August 1941 (sponsored by Mrs. Elizabeth H. Hogan) and commissioned on 15 December 1941 with Lieutenant Commander Creed C. Burlingame (Class of 1927) in command.

''Silversides'' was one of the must successful submarines in the Pacific Theater of World War II with 23 confirmed sinkings totalling more than 90000 tonnes of shipping.  She received Presidential Unit Citations four times and twelve battle stars.  She presently serves as a museum ship in Muskegon Michigan and is a National Historic Landmark.

474031,Dirofilaria immitis,Introduction,"


'''''Dirofilaria immitis''''' the '''heartworm''' or '''dog heartworm''' is a parasitic roundworm that is spread from host to host through the bites of mosquitoes. The heartworm is a type of filarial worm a small thread-like worm that causes filariasis. The definitive host is the dog but it can also infect cats wolves coyotes jackals foxes and other animals such as ferrets bears sea lions and even under very rare circumstances humans. The parasite is commonly called ""heartworm""; however adults often reside in the pulmonary arterial system (lung arteries) as well as the heart and a major effect on the health for the animal is a manifestation of damage to the lung vessels and tissues. Occasionally adult heartworms migrate to the right heart and even the great veins in heavy infections. Heartworm infection may result in serious disease for the host with death typically as the result of congestive heart failure.
"
1460,Brassicales,Introduction,"

The '''Brassicales''' (or '''Cruciales''') are an order of flowering plants belonging to the eurosids II group of dicotyledons under the APG II system. One character common to many members of the order is the production of glucosinolate (mustard oil) compounds. Most systems of classification have included this order although sometimes under the name '''Capparales''' (the name chosen depending on which is thought to have priority).

The order typically contains the following families:
* Akaniaceae - two species of turnipwood trees native to Asia and eastern Australia
* Bataceae – salt-tolerant shrubs from America and Australasia
* Brassicaceae – mustard and cabbage family; may include the Cleomaceae
* Capparaceae – caper family sometimes included in Brassicaceae
* Caricaceae – papaya family
* Cleomaceae
* Gyrostemonaceae - several genera of small shrubs and trees endemic to temperate parts of Australia
* Koeberliniaceae - one species of thorn bush native to Mexico and the US Southwest
* Limnanthaceae – meadowfoam family
* Moringaceae – thirteen species of trees from Africa and India
* Pentadiplandraceae - African species whose berries have two highly sweet tasting proteins
* Resedaceae – mignonette family
* Salvadoraceae - three genera found from Africa to Java
* Setchellanthaceae
* Tovariaceae
* Tropaeolaceae – nasturtium family

Under the Cronquist system the Brassicales were called the Capparales and included among the ""Dilleniidae"".  The only families included were the Brassicaceae and Capparaceae (treated as separate families) the Tovariaceae Resedaceae and Moringaceae.  Other taxa now included here were placed in various other orders.

''Cleome hassleriana''

The families Capparaceae and Brassicaceae are closely related.  One group consisting of ''Cleome'' and related genera was traditionally included in the Capparaceae but doing so results in a paraphyletic Capparaceae.  Therefore this group is generally now either included in the Brassicaceae or as its own family Cleomaceae.

492449,Promise of the Witch King,Plot summary,"
Leaving behind their past Artemis Entreri and Jarlaxle Baenre become mercenaries in the lands of Damara and Vaasa where fame and glory await any who seek it.  They are hired by two dragon sisters Ilnezhara and Tazmikella to uncover artifacts left behind by Zhengyi the Witch-King a powerful lich who ruled the region for many years before falling to the power of King Gareth Dragonsbane and his allies. In search of adventure glory and treasure the pair of unlikely heroes embarks on their mission to destroy or retrieve the remaining remnants of Zhengyi's power. In the village of Palishchuk a half-orc woman Arrayan Faylin falls under the spell of the vanquished Zhengyi when she attempts to decipher a tome he left behind. The spell drains her life force to form an exact replica of Castle Perilous the citadel from which the Witch-King once ruled. Jarlaxle and Entreri join forces with a group of adventurers including Commander Ellery legendary hero Mariabronne the Rover assassins Athrogate and Canthan the half-elf warrior Calihye and half-orcs Arrayan and Olgerkhan and set out to investigate the fortress facsimile. After a battle against some monsters Calihye's close friend Parissus is killed falling out of a wagon driven by Entreri. Blaming him for the woman's death Calihye vows to kill him but has different thoughts after Entreri effortlessly disarms her and promises to kill her slowly if she ever threatens him again. As with the original Castle Perilous the citadel's magic creates an endless supply of gargoyles who begin to attack the heroes as well as the poorly defended town of Palishchuk where Calihye and another injured member of their party are nestled. Jarlaxle and company defeat the gargoyles easily enough and manage to infiltrate the castle where they split up. Arrayan having sustained too many wounds compounded with the life-draining burden of the spell is on her last legs. The wizard Canthan turns on Entreri but proves to be overmatched by the dangerous assassin and is perfunctorily killed. In a rare moment of compassion Entreri drags the dying body of Arrayan's lover who is also sharing the burden of the castles dark magic over to Canthan and as the wizard breathes his last breath places the half-orc's hand upon his dagger to suck Canthan's remaining life force and heal her. An isolated Mariabronne stumbles upon a chamber with demon eggs hanging from the ceiling. The eggs hatch and Mariabronne manages to defeat them but is stung in the process and injected with deadly venom. Commander Ellery is left alone with Jarlaxle and attempts to assassinate him. A fight promptly ensues although Jarlaxle seems reluctant to kill her as they have been lovers for some time and the opportunistic mercenary would always prefer to bed women than slay them but Entreri shows up and mortally wounds her with his jeweled dagger. When the remnants of the band reunite Athrogate takes it upon himself to do what Canthan could not and proceeds to duel against Entreri. Despite all his considerable skill Entreri's parry and thrust style of fighting is no match for Athrogate's deadly morningstars. He would have promptly been killed but for Jarlaxle who tosses a dimensional hole concealed in his hat at the dwarf. Athrogate becomes imprisoned in a void and agrees to obey Jarlaxle in return for his freedom. The five remaining companions venture into the heart of the castle where they are met by a powerful dracolich who served as a minion for Zhengyi. Seemingly unstoppable the dracolich gives the heroes a hellacious fight but is finally defeated when Entreri's enchanted dragon statue spews dragon flame upon it. Jarlaxle never one to pass up powerful magic quickly salvages the soul of the dracolich contained in a skull pendant as well as a magical figurine for summoning a nightmare steed off Mariabronne's corpse.

375470,F. C. D. Wyneken,Early life and family and education,"The University of Halle in 1836
Wyneken was born to Pastor Heinrich Christoph Wyneken (1766-1815) and Anne Catherine Louise Wyneken nee Meyer (1773-1863) on May 13 1810 in Verden an der Aller in the Kingdom of Westphalia. Some of the earlier Wynekens and their relatives were minor government officials in the Duchy of Bremen-Verden when it was under Swedish control. The Wyneken family had an established Lutheran heritage long before Friedrich arrived in America. Heinrich Wyneken's father grandfather and one brother were pastors in Hanover. Two of Friedrich Wyneken's older brothers also became pastors. Significant numbers of more distant relatives and in-laws were also Lutheran clergy members such as Superintendent Hans Heinrich Justus Phillip Ruperti (1833-1899) who was Friedrich's nephew.

Other Wyneken relatives had military careers in the Electorate of Hanover and others would serve in army of the Kingdom of Hanover. Friedrich Wyneken's maternal grandfather was a Rittmeister stationed in Verden. Wyneken's second cousin Christian Wilhelm August Johann Ernst Wyneken (1783- 1853) fought in the King's German Legion in Spain and at the Battle of Waterloo and later became a Lieutenant General in the Hanoverian Army and led a German contingent in the First Schleswig War. Much later a third cousin Hans Kannengiesser (1880-1970) would fight at Gallipoli and later become a generalleutnant.

Wyneken was baptized on May 22 1810 by his father at St. Andreas Church in Verden. Heinrich Wyneken died five years later leaving eleven children and a widow behind. Friedrich attended the Gymnasium in Verden. At the age of seventeen he went to the University of Göttingen but soon enrolled at the University of Halle. Neither of these institutions had a reputation for the dogmatic Lutheran orthodoxy which Wyneken was later to embrace; rather they both promoted strong rationalistic viewpoints. At Halle Wyneken became a student of August Tholuck a skilled linguist and a believer in the personal religious experience.

After graduation Wyneken worked as a private instructor in Lesum (now a locality of Bremen) at the home of Consistorial Counsellor Georg von Henfstengel himself an ""Awakened"" pastor. During this time Wyneken came more influenced by the Erweckungsbewegung (""Awakening"" movement led by Tholuck). He was ordained in Stade along with his fellow theology student E.W. Wolff on May 8 1837 and soon the pair secured free passage to America from an ""Awakened"" sea-captain Stuerge and the blessing of the Stade Bible and Mission Society.

235674,Lobo (DC Comics),Publication history,"Lobo was introduced as a regular character in Keith Giffen and Roger Slifer’s ''Green Lantern'' and ''Teen Titans'' spin-off ''Omega Men''. At that time he was a Velorpian whose entire race had been exterminated by Psions and was partnered with Bedlam whom he later killed; his origin was later retconned.

After a well-received appearance in ''Justice League International'' Lobo became a regular character in ''L.E.G.I.O.N.'' and its successor series ''R.E.B.E.L.S.''.

In 1990 he appeared in his four-issue own mini-series ''Lobo: The Last Czarnian'' plotted by Giffen written by Alan Grant and with art by Simon Bisley which changed his origin story: he became the last Czarnian after violently killing every other member of the species. That mini-series led to many subsequent mini-series and specials including ''Lobocop'' a RoboCop parody; ''Blazing Chain of Love'' in which he is sent on a job to a harem; ''Paramilitary Christmas Special'' in which he is contracted by the Easter Bunny to assassinate Santa Claus; ''Infanticide'' where he kills his daughter and all of his other offspring that she has gathered to try to kill him; ''Convention Special'' a send-up of comic book conventions; and ''Unamerican Gladiators'' in which Lobo takes part in a deadly televised game show. Simon Bisley's dark humor fits well within the pages of his artwork by having countless mutilations of background characters occurring in each panel. Lobo also starred in his own DC title for 64 issues from 1993 to 1999.

Lobo has regularly made guest appearances in other series even in cross-company interactions with such non-DC characters as The Mask Judge Dredd and the Authority. During the ''DC vs. Marvel'' crossover series he fought Wolverine and lost due to popular vote by fans. He also appeared very briefly in the ''JLA/Avengers'' inter-company crossover and is shown fighting members of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard although the outcome is not shown.

Lobo has made a few appearances in the animated series of the 1990s/2000s-era DC Animated Universe. At one point an animated series and video game starring the character were to be released but both were cancelled. However an web-series was made in 2000 with 14 shorts.

256513,Criticism of Microsoft,Acquisitions,"Microsoft has acquired several companies and products during its history including some that competed with earlier Microsoft products. Such acquired assets include DOS (Seattle Computer Products QDOS) FrontPage (Vermeer Technologies Incorporated FrontPage) WebTV (now MSN TV) Hotmail Direct3D Internet Explorer (Spyglass Inc. Mosaic) Visio (Visio Corporation Visio) Windows Virtual PC (Connectix Virtual PC) and Windows Defender (GIANT Company Software Inc. GIANT AntiSpyware). Microsoft rebrands the primary products of the companies it acquires and in many cases offers them for free or bundles them with their operating system. Former Sun Microsystems chief executive Scott McNealy occasionally remarked that Microsoft never produced technology except by buying it: ""R&D research and development and M&A mergers and acquisitions are the same thing over there.""

Let's find the square root of 46785399 with the bones.

First group its digits in twos starting from the right so it looks
like this:

: 46 78 53 99

: ''Note:'' A number like 85399 would be grouped as 8 53 99

Start with the leftmost group 46. Pick the largest square on the
square root bone less than 46 which is 36 from the sixth row.

Because we picked the sixth row the first digit of the solution is 6.

Now read the second column from the sixth row on the square root bone
12 and set 12 on the board.

Then subtract the value in the first
column of the sixth row 36 from 46.

Append to this the next group of
digits in the number 78 to get the remainder 1078.

At the end of this step the board and intermediate calculations
should look like this:

Now ""read"" the numbers in each row ignoring the second and third columns
from the square root bone and record these. (For example read the sixth
row as : 0/6 1/2 3/6 → 756)

Find the largest number less than the current remainder 1078.
You should find that 1024 from the eighth row is the largest value
less than 1078.

As before append 8 to get the next digit of the square root and
subtract the value of the eighth row 1024 from the current remainder
1078 to get 54. Read the second column of the eighth row on the square
root bone 16 and set the number on the board as follows.

The current number on the board is 12. Add to it the first digit of
16 and append the second digit of 16 to the result. So you should set
the board to
: 12 + 1 = 13 → append 6 → 136

: ''Note:'' If the second column of the square root bone has only one digit just append it to the current number on board.

The board and intermediate calculations now look like this.

The next digit of the square root is 3. Repeat the same steps as
before and subtract 4089 from the current remainder 5453 to get 1364
as the next remainder. When you rearrange the board notice that the
second column of the square root bone is 6 a single digit. So just
append 6 to the current number on the board 136
: 136 → append 6 → 1366
to set 1366 on the board.

Repeat these operations once more. Now the largest value on the board
smaller than the current remainder 136499 is 123021 from the ninth
row.

In practice you often don't need to find the value of every row to
get the answer. You may be able to guess which row has the answer by
looking at the number on the first few bones on the board and
comparing it with the first few digits of the remainder. But in these
diagrams we show the values of all rows to make it easier to
understand.

As usual append a 9 to the result and subtract 123021 from the
current remainder.

You've now ""used up"" all the digits of our number and you still have
a remainder. This means you've got the integer portion of the square
root but there's some fractional bit still left.

Notice that if we've really got the integer part of the square root
the current result squared (6839² = 46771921) must be the
largest perfect square smaller than 46785899.  Why? The square root of
46785399 is going to be something like 6839.xxxx... This means
6839² is smaller than 46785399 but 6840² is
bigger than 46785399—the same thing as saying that 6839²
is the largest perfect square smaller than 46785399.

This idea is used later on to understand how the technique works but
for now let's continue to generate more digits of the square root.

Similar to finding the fractional portion of the answer in
long division append two zeros to the remainder to get
the new remainder 1347800. The second column of the ninth row of the
square root bone is 18 and the current number on the board is 1366. So
compute
: 1366 + 1 → 1367 → append 8 → 13678
to set 13678 on the board.

The board and intermediate computations now look like this.

You can continue these steps to find as many digits as you need and
you stop when you have the precision you want or if you find that the
remainder becomes zero which means you have the exact square root.

Having found the desired number of digits you can easily determine whether or not you need to round up; i.e. increment the last digit.  You don't need to find another digit to see if it is equal to or greater than five.  Simply append 25 to the root and compare that to the remainder; if it is less than or equal to the remainder then the next digit will be at least five and round up is needed.  In the example above we see that 6839925 is less than 11669900 so we need to round up the root to 6840.0.

There's only one more trick left to describe. If you want to find the
square root of a number that isn't an integer say 54782.917.
Everything is the same except you start out by grouping the digits
to the left and right of the decimal point in groups of two.

That is group 54782.917 as

: 5 47 82 . 91 7

and proceed to extract the square root from these groups of digits.

511577,Tripartite Convention,Positions as a result of the Tripartite Convention of 1899,"'''United States''':
Seal of American Samoa
:President William McKinley signed an executive order on 19 February 1900 reading: ""The Island of Tutuila of the Samoan Group and all other islands of the group east of longitude 171 degrees west of Greenwich are hereby placed under the control of the Department of the Navy for a naval station.  The Secretary of the Navy shall take such steps as are necessary to establish the authority of the United States and to give to the islands the necessary protection.""  On the same day John D. Long Secretary of the Navy stated further that these islands ""... are hereby established into a naval station to be known as the naval station Tutuila and to be under the command of a commandant.""  Rose Island an uninhabited coral atoll and the island of Aunu'u were included.  The cession of deeds of the islands of the Manua Group (Ta'u and Ofu-Olosega) did not take place until 1904 although the respective chiefs had previously accepted the sovereignty of the United States. The term American Samoa entered into conscious usage in 1905 with a first assembly or ''fono'' of Samoan chiefs from all ceded islands within the naval station.

Coat of Arms of German Samoa
'''Germany''':
:The Samoan islands of Upolu and Savaii and the small islands of Apolima and Manono west of 171 degrees west longitude were declared a protectorate of the German Empire and became known as German Samoa with flag raising on 1 March 1900 and appointment of Wilhelm Solf as governor. This ""happy acquisition"" was viewed in Germany as a ""splendid achievement in colonial policy which is at the same time a genuinely popular one.""

'''United Kingdom''':
:By surrendering all rights in Samoa the United Kingdom ""obtained extensive compensation from Germany elsewhere"" in effect ""transfer of all of the German rights in the Tonga group including that of establishing a naval and coaling station and the right of extraterritoriality; the shifting of the line of demarcation between German and British islands in the Solomon group so as to give to Great Britain all the German islands to the east and southeast of the island of Bougainville; the division of the so-called neutral zone in West Africa by a definite boundary line between British and German possessions; the promise of Germany to take into consideration as much and as far as possible the wishes which the Government of Great Britain may express with regard to the development of  reciprocal tariffs in the territories of Togo and the Gold Coast; the renouncing by Germany of her rights of extraterritoriality in Zanzibar.""

These treaty arrangements of the Tripartite Convention of 1899 stayed in place until the outbreak of World War I in 1914.

709086,Madras Regiment,History,"The town of Madras was founded in 1639 and the first Fort Saint George in 1644 but the military history of the Presidency does not commence until more than a century later. In August 1758 they were formed into regular companies of 100 men each with a due proportion of Indian officers havildars naiks etc. and in December of that year the first two battalions were formed with a European subaltern to each company and a captain to command the whole. (These officers were mostly seconded from the King's service with a step in rank. They were of a better class better educated and above all had far more military experience than the company's officers).

Sepoys of the Bombay Bengal and Madras Armies
The Madras Regiment was initially formed as the Madras European Regiment in the 1660s by the East India Company as the second company established in India. However it was formed as a battalion in 1748 under the command of Major Stringer Lawrence. The battalion was involved in all the battles against the French forces in India. Lawrence structured the regiment to include two battalions one European and one ''Sepoy'' (Indian). Both battalions were similar in structure and included seven companies each with each company including three officers in command and seventy privates. Also part of the companies were four sergeants and corporals and three drummers.

The oldest Battalion in the Madras Regiment (and the Indian Army) was the 9th Battalion formerly known as the Nair Brigade (''Nayar Pattalam'' ""Nair Army""). This militia was raised in 1704 at Padmanabhapuram as body guards for the Maharajah of Travancore and were active in the Battle of Colachel in defeating the Dutch forces. The army was made up of soldiers from Nair warrior clans however after the 1940s non-Nairs were permitted to join. The ""Nayar Army"" became incorporated into the Indian Army on April 1951.

In 1748 Major Stringer Lawrence a veteran of action in Spain Flanders and the Highlands was hired by the East India Company to take charge of the defence of Cuddalore. He laid the foundations of what was to become the Indian Army. Training the levies to become a militia the Madras Levies were formed into ""companies"" and trained to become a disciplined and fine fighting force. In 1758 Lawrence raised the Madras Regiment forming the several Companies of Madras Levies into two battalions. 2 Madras was raised in 1776 as the 15th Carnatic Infantry at Thanjavur (and underwent many nomenclature changes thereafter). The regiment has been through many campaigns with both the British Indian Army and the Indian Army. Many well-known British officers have commanded this regiment among them Robert Clive. This regiment fought in the Carnatic wars which were fought in South India. The elephant crest symbolises its gallantry in the Battle of Assaye under Arthur Wellesley later Duke of Wellington.

There after the British annexed the Indian sub-continent largely with the help of the Madras Regiment sepoys. The coming of the British rule and merging the Presidency armies into a British Indian Army led the erstwhile regiments to be reorganised. After conquest of India the main perceived threat to British was from Russia. So recruitment was re-oriented towards north Indians of Punjab and Nepal. This resulted in the British reducing the strength of the Madras Regiment since the southern borders were relatively peaceful. After many years this regiment was re-raised with fresh recruits and a draft of troops from the Madras Sappers during World War II. The newly reborn Madras Regiment performed very creditably during the Burma Campaign.

155210,William Slim 1st Viscount Slim,Post-war career,"===Initial retirement from the army===
At the end of 1945 Slim returned to the UK. On 1 January 1946 he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE). and took the post of Commandant of the Imperial Defence College for its first course since 1939. On 7 February 1947 he was made an Aide-de-camp (ADC) to the King. At the end of his two-year appointment at the Imperial Defence College Slim retired as ADC and from the army on 11 May 1948. He had been approached by both India and Pakistan to become C-in-C of their respective armies post independence but refused and instead became Deputy Chairman of the Railway Executive.

===Return to the army===
However in November 1948 the British Prime Minister Clement Attlee rejected the proposal by Viscount Montgomery that he should be succeeded as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) by John Crocker and instead brought back Slim from retirement in the rank of field marshal in January 1949 with formal appointment to the Army Council from 1 January 1949. Slim thus became the first Indian Army officer to be become CIGS.

On 2 January 1950 he was promoted to Knight Grand Cross in the Order of the Bath (GCB) and later that year was made a Chief Commander of the Legion of Merit by the United States having previously in 1948 been awarded the lower ranking Commander of the Legion of Merit. On 1 November 1952 he relinquished the position of Chief of the Imperial General Staff.

===Governor-General of Australia===
On 10 December 1952 Slim was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) on his appointment as Governor-General of Australia which post he took up on 8 May 1953. On 2 January 1953 he was appointed a Knight of the Order of St. John (KStJ). Slim was a popular choice for Governor-General since he was an authentic war hero who had fought alongside Australians at Gallipoli and in the Middle East. In 1954 he was able to welcome Queen Elizabeth II on the first visit by a reigning monarch to Australia. For his services to the Queen during the tour he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) on 27 April 1954. Liberal leader Robert Menzies held office throughout Slim's time in Australia. His Official Secretary throughout his term was Murray Tyrrell.

===Retirement===
In 1959 Slim retired and returned to Britain where he published his memoirs ''Unofficial History''. He had already published his personal narrative of the Burma Campaign ''Defeat into Victory'' in 1956. On 24 April 1959 he was appointed a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter (KG). On 15 July 1960 he was created ""Viscount Slim of Yarralumla in the Capital Territory of Australia and of Bishopston in the City and County of Bristol"". After a successful further career on the boards of major UK companies he was appointed Constable and Governor of Windsor Castle on 18 June 1964. He died in London on 14 December 1970 aged 79 and was given a full military funeral at St. George's Chapel Windsor and was afterwards cremated.

377860,Leitch Ritchie,Life,"Ritchie was at first an apprentice in a banking office but at an early age went to London with letters of introduction to literary people. Called back by his father to take up a position in a Glasgow trading firm he started in 1818 with some friends a fortnightly publication ''The Wanderers'' which ran to 21 numbers (4 April 1818 to 9 January 1819). The Glasgow firm became bankrupt and Ritchie again went to London.

Working as a professional writer Ritchie sent articles to the ''Foreign Quarterly Review'' the ''Westminster Review'' and other periodicals. The ''London Weekly Review'' on which he had been employed passed into other hands he and the former editor James Augustus St. John went to live in Normandy. Books made his reputation and from this period he had enough work. In addition to his other engagements he with William Kennedy started a monthly periodical ''The Englishman's Magazine'' which ran to seven numbers (April to October 1831) when his own illness caused its abandonment.

For some time Ritchie was editor of ''The Era'' a sporting and dramatic newspaper and was subsequently first editor of the ''Indian News and Chronicle of Eastern Affairs'' (No. 1 11 June 1840) the copyright of which he was eventually given by the proprietor; and he later sold the newspaper. The latter part of his working life was spent in Scotland in editing ''Chambers's Journal'' and other publications by his employers. During this period he lived on St Bernards Crescent in Stockbridge Edinburgh where he befriended his neighbour Andrew Crichton.

On 19 June 1862 Ritchie was granted a civil list pension. Retiring to London he died at 1 Earlswood Terrace East Greenwich on 16 January 1865. He left a daughter Mrs. Hughes who resided at Perry Green Hertfordshire.
"
20288,George IV of the United Kingdom,Regency crisis of 1788,"Portrait published by Sir Joshua Reynolds 1785
In the summer of 1788 the King's mental health deteriorated possibly as the result of the hereditary disease porphyria. He was nonetheless able to discharge some of his duties and to declare Parliament prorogued from 25 September to 20 November. During the prorogation he became deranged posing a threat to his own life and when Parliament reconvened in November the King could not deliver the customary speech from the throne during the State Opening of Parliament. Parliament found itself in an untenable position: according to long-established law it could not proceed to any business until the delivery of the King's Speech at a State Opening.

Although arguably barred from doing so Parliament began debating a regency. In the House of Commons Charles James Fox declared his opinion that the Prince of Wales was automatically entitled to exercise sovereignty during the King's incapacity. A contrasting opinion was held by the prime minister William Pitt the Younger who argued that in the absence of a statute to the contrary the right to choose a regent belonged to Parliament alone. He even stated that without parliamentary authority ""the Prince of Wales had no more right ... to assume the government than any other individual subject of the country."" Though disagreeing on the principle underlying a regency Pitt agreed with Fox that the Prince of Wales would be the most convenient choice for a regent.
Miniature by Richard Cosway 1792
The Prince of Wales—though offended by Pitt's boldness—did not lend his full support to Fox's approach. The Prince of Wales's brother Prince Frederick Duke of York declared that George would not attempt to exercise any power without previously obtaining the consent of Parliament. Following the passage of preliminary resolutions Pitt outlined a formal plan for the regency suggesting that the powers of the Prince of Wales be greatly limited. Among other things the Prince of Wales would not be able either to sell the King's property or to grant a peerage to anyone other than a child of the King. The Prince of Wales denounced Pitt's scheme declaring it a ""project for producing weakness disorder and insecurity in every branch of the administration of affairs."" In the interests of the nation both factions agreed to compromise.

A significant technical impediment to any Regency Bill involved the lack of a speech from the throne which was necessary before Parliament could proceed to any debates or votes. The speech was normally delivered by the King but could also be delivered by royal representatives known as Lords Commissioners; but no document could empower the Lords Commissioners to act unless the Great Seal of the Realm was affixed to it. The seal could not be legally affixed without the prior authorisation of the sovereign. Pitt and his fellow ministers ignored the last requirement and instructed the Lord Chancellor to affix the Great Seal without the King's consent as the act of affixing the Great Seal in itself gave legal force to the bill. This legal fiction was denounced by Edmund Burke as a ""glaring falsehood"" as a ""palpable absurdity"" and even as a ""forgery fraud"". The Duke of York described the plan as ""unconstitutional and illegal."" Nevertheless others in Parliament felt that such a scheme was necessary to preserve an effective government. Consequently on 3 February 1789 more than two months after it had convened Parliament was formally opened by an ""illegal"" group of Lords Commissioners. The Regency Bill was introduced but before it could be passed the King recovered. The King declared retroactively that the instrument authorising the Lords Commissioners to act was valid.

763761,Noriko's Dinner Table,Plot,"The film is divided into 5 chapters the first four of which are named after characters in the film: Noriko Yuka Kumiko and Tetsuzo in that order. The plot is told non-linearly and shifts between the perspectives of Noriko Yuka and Tetsuzo.

A shy and demure 17-year-old teenage girl named Noriko Shimabara (Kazue Fukiishi) lives with her quiet family formed by her sister Yuka (Yuriko Yoshitaka) her mother Taeko (Sanae Miyata) and her father Tetsuzo (Ken Mitsuishi) in Toyokawa Japan. Noriko finds her small-town life unsatisfying and craves to move to Tokyo assuming she would live a more active life there. This sentiment is especially encouraged when she finds that her elementary school friend Tangerine (Yoko Mitsuya) is now working independently as an idol. Noriko's father is strictly against her going to the city and plans on having her join a local university after school.

Feeling alienated and misunderstood by her parents Noriko resorts to the internet where she finds Haikyo.com a website where other teenagers from Japan gather. There after making new and unknown friends she feels truly at ""home"" and eventually on December 10 2001 runs away from her unhappy life to Tokyo where she plans on meeting the website's leader a mysterious girl who uses the screen name ""Ueno Station 54"". Once in Tokyo Noriko logs onto the website and contacts Ueno54. They meet up at Locker #54 in Ueno Train Station where it is revealed that she is a young woman named Kumiko. She introduces Noriko to her family and takes Noriko to visit her grandparents. As it turns out however Kumiko has no real family and the people she introduced Noriko to are paid actors working for Kumiko's organisation I.C. Corp. The organisation offers paid roleplay services to interested clients allowing them to fulfil their fantasies of a happy family life.

Six months later 54 girls jump in front of a train at Shinjuku station and commit suicide while Noriko and Kumiko look on. It is implied that the 54 were members of the organization acting out their roles. Back in Toyokawa Yuka who was also a member of Haikyo.com wonders if her sister was involved in the mass suicide. She writes a story speculating how her father would react if she were to disappear as well and deliberately leaves clues before running off to Tokyo to join I.C. Corp.

Tetsuzo attempts to put on a brave face after Yuka's disappearance but his wife Taeko's mental condition deteriorates rapidly and she eventually commits suicide. Meanwhile Tetsuzo a reporter gathers clues regarding his daughters' disappearances and discovers Yuka's story. He is crushed to find that his daughter could predict his actions and behaviour so accurately while he was completely aloof of his daughters' feelings. His investigations reveal Haikyo.com and taking a cue from sensationalist media tabloids he concludes that his daughters are part of a cult called the ""Suicide Club"".

Tetsuzo contacts a member of I.C. Corp who refutes the existence of a ""suicide club"" and instead expounds on a concept of social roles that forms the basis of his organisation. Tetsuzo gets an old friend of his Ikeda (Shirou Namiki) to pose as a client for I.C. Corp and rent Kumiko as his wife and Noriko and Yuka as his daughters (who go by the aliases Mitsuko and Yoko respectively). Tetsuzo finds a house in Tokyo resembling his own and moves all the furniture from the old house to the new one to resemble it exactly. Mitsuko and Yoko are unsettled when they arrive at the house but fall back into their roles when prompted by Kumiko. Ikeda sends Kumiko away on an errand and Tetsuzo reveals himself. The girls however treat him as a stranger and insist that they are Mitsuko and Yoko not Noriko and Yuka.

As the session falls apart thugs from the organisation arrive on site to beat up Tetsuzo who attacks them with a knife and kills all of them in the living room. Kumiko arrives from her errand shortly thereafter playing out her role as if nothing is wrong but then implores Tetsuzo to kill her and run away with Noriko and Yuka. Her insistence gravely disturbs Noriko and Yuka before Yuka interrupts the heated conversation and asks to 'extend the session'.

Finally Tetsuzo Kumiko Mitsuko and Yuka dine together as a happy family and Tetsuzo begins acting as if Kumiko is his wife calling her Taeko. Yuka does not sleep that night and at the leaves the home at crack of dawn shedding her roles and names. Mitsuko awakens shortly thereafter and to herself bids goodbye to Yuka adolescence Haikyo.com and Mitsuko before finally declaring that she is Noriko.

By the end two years have passed in this film and 18 months since ''Suicide Club''.

149463,Winston Peters,2008 election,"Peters in 2008
Peters tried to regain Tauranga in the 2008 election and lost to National's Simon Bridges by a margin of 11742 votes a much larger loss than in 2005. With New Zealand First gaining 4.07 percent of the vote and failing to reach the 5 percent threshold to enter Parliament without winning an electorate seat Peters did not enter the 49th New Zealand Parliament. In his concession speech Peters promised ""This is not the end"" and alluded to the fact that while New Zealand First would not have any members in Parliament it was still New Zealand's fourth largest political party with 4.07 percent of the vote. Despite this political commentators described the defeat as ""the end of the road"" for Peters.

Peters generally shunned the media spotlight following the election. In 2009 he caused a brief flurry of interest when it was revealed he was still using a ministerial car some months after his election defeat. Later it was reported he had started writing a rugby column for a local magazine. He appeared on TV ONE's Q & A programme on 5 July 2009 confirming that he was still the leader of New Zealand First. He hinted at a political comeback and attacked the New Zealand government's review of the Foreshore and Seabed Act.  In late 2010 and early 2011 Peters made a number of appearances on television and radio where he made it clear his and New Zealand First's intention to contest the 2011 election.  New Zealand First's annual convention in July 2011 received widespread media coverage and somewhat restored the media's interest in Peters and the party.

496106,Fascist (insult),Possible explanations for casual uses,"
The swastika is often used to symbolize anything or anyone perceived as fascist.
Following the end of the Second World War no group wanted to affiliate with the term ""fascist"" and both the propaganda systems of the USSR and Western World branded fascism as an irrational ideology because it stood in opposition to those of the Allies. The term subsequently lost all significant meaning. Marxist theorists such as Trotskyists which harbor an economic and materialist view of history examined fascism strictly from an economic point of view. This led them to conclude that fascism was merely a form of extreme reactionary state capitalism since fascist states adopted corporatism promoted class collaboration protected private property and wanted to eradicate all forms of socialism.

While attracting criticisms for imprecision and for downplaying the extremity of actual fascism the use of ''fascist'' as an epithet for authoritarian and intolerant power-holders has a distinct analytical basis suggesting that fascism is a continuum or a social relation rather than simply a political system and that acts of repression are in some way homologous with fascist ideology. Specifically it seems that the imputation is an interest in authoritarianism strong enough to deny interest in the legitimacy of that authority.



Several Marxist theories back up particular uses of ''fascism'' beyond its usual remit.  For instance Poulantzas's theory of state monopoly capitalism could be associated with the idea of a military-industrial complex to suggest that 1960s America had a fascist social structure; this kind of Maoist or Guevarist analysis often underpinned the rhetorical depiction of Cold War authoritarians as fascists.

Some Marxist groups – such as the Indian section of the USFI and the Hekmatist groups in Iran and Iraq – have provided analytical accounts as to why the term ''fascist'' should be applied to groups such as the Hindutva movement the 1979 Islamic Iranian regime or the Islamist sections of the Iraqi insurgency. Other scholars contend that the traditional meaning of the term fascism does not apply to Hindutva groups and may hinder an analysis of their activities.

378598,Hoplology,Overview,"Hoplology encompasses the segment of human culture concerned with weapons armor combative accouterments and fighting systems in regard to their technical characteristics and the ways in which they interact with the economic political social and religious institutions of human societies and  has three main research areas: technological functional and behavioral.

* Technological hoplology studies the development of weapons armor and other combative tools in relation to the contexts in which they are created.
*Functional hoplology delves into the structure development and organization of combative systems and their relationship to the application of fighting and weapons.
* Behavioral hoplology encompasses the psychological and physiological factors that affect human’s combative behavior and development of combative capabilities such as weapons or fighting systems. The broad subject range of behavioral hoplology means it also includes the effects that culture has had on man’s evolution as a group-social animal.

There are three widely accepted axioms in hoplological studies.

* human combative behavior is rooted in man’s evolution. 
* humans exhibit two types of aggression: affective aggression and predatory aggression. Both forms evolved from different survival needs as both a group-social animal and as a hunting animal. 
* the evolution of human combative behavior is directly linked to the use of weapons. That is to say that the use of weapons is linked with and reflects combative performance and behavior.

A variation on the pragmatics of hoplological understanding is found in theatrical representations of combat.  While hoplology is still in its infancy it has become an accepted area of study by scholars in several related disciplines such as combative psychology killology anthropology and military history.

339537,USS Kilty (DD-137),Service history,"After a Caribbean shakedown and a European cruise during the summer of 1919 ''Kilty'' returned to San Diego and operated there until she decommissioned 5 June 1922.

===World War II===
''Kilty'' recommissioned 18 December 1939 and in April 1940 sailed on Neutrality Patrol out of San Diego. During the summer she conducted reserve training cruises and resumed her patrols early in September. The destroyer continued these operations until the United States entered World War II. Then ''Kilty'' intensified ASW patrols trained armed-guard crews for merchantmen and escorted coastal convoys throughout 1942.

Reclassified '''APD-15''' on 2 January 1943 ''Kilty'' cleared Mare Island 2 March for the South Pacific. After arriving Noumea 8 April with a Marine Raiders battalion the transport steamed toward Guadalcanal as an ASW screen 28 April. She made similar cruises until June when she reported for patrol and escort duty in the Solomons. ''Kilty'' played a vital role in the conquest of the Solomons landing troops of the 37th Division on New Georgia Island 30 June and 4 July. Continuing operations in the area she made three reinforcement runs up the ""Slot"" during July and landed troops on Vella Lavella Island 15 August.

As Allied operations built up momentum ''Kilty'' moved on to the Treasury Islands Campaign. She successfully landed New Zealand troops on Stirling Island 27 October and a Marine force on Bougainville 9 days later enabling Allied Forces to bypass Rabaul. ''Kilty'' effectively aided this campaign in three more landings before sailing for Brisbane 21 November.

Returning Milne Bay in mid-December the transport began preparing for the assault on the Bismarck Archipelago. ''Kilty'' landed units of the 7th Marine Regiment for the initial attack on Cape Gloucester New Britain 26 December. Following two more landings there she sent troops ashore at Saidor 2 January 1944 to take an air strip which would help the Air Force patrol and support Cape Gloucester. ''Kilty''s next objective was Green Island where she landed troops on 15 and 20 February before returning to Port Purvis.

Following an unopposed assault on Emirau Island 20 March the transport prepared for the Hollandia campaign. Completing landings at Aitape 22 April ''Kilty'' then participated in New Guinea landings including Wakde 17 May and Biak 10 days later before putting into Humboldt Bay 28 May.

After a minor overhaul at Milne Bay she landed troops on Cape Sansopor 30 July before sailing to Sydney. Returning to Humboldt Bay 30 August ''Kilty'' landed troops on Morotai 15 September to complete her operations in New Guinea area. ''Kilty'' departed Hollandia 12 October as part of the spearhead for the giant Leyte assault that bore down on the enemy like a typhoon. In the advance assault force she landed rangers on Dinagat in the entrance to Leyte Gulf 17 October to pave the way for the main Philippine invasion. While ''Kilty'' was returning to Hollandia 23 October the U.S. Fleet was crushing the Japanese Navy in the famous battle for Leyte Gulf.

During another cruise to Leyte in mid-November the transport splashed two Aichi D3A ""Vals"" before they could crash into American LSTs. Continuing operations in the strategic Philippines ''Kilty'' landed troops 15 December in the invasion of Mindoro and on 11 January 1945 supported the Luzon landings. She made additional landings at Nasugbu 31 January and at Corregidor in mid-February before sailing for Ulithi 25 February for overhaul.

Battle-proven ''Kilty'' cleared Ulithi 2 April as escort to four escort carriers ferrying planes to the Okinawa beachhead. During May she made another escort cruise from Saipan to Okinawa and on the 4th rescued survivors from  sunk during a ''kamikaze'' attack. With the Okinawa campaign well under way ''Kilty'' departed Guam 17 May and arrived San Diego 18 June for overhaul. Redesignated '''DD-137''' on 20 July 1945 ''Kilty'' was still in the yard as the war came to an end. The veteran destroyer decommissioned 2 November 1945 and was sold 26 August 1946 to the National Metal & Steel Corporation for scrapping.

378201,Titi,Introduction,"


The '''titis''' or '''titi monkeys''' are the New World monkeys of the subfamily '''Callicebinae''' which contains three extant genera ''Cheracebus'' ''Callicebus'' and ''Plecturocebus.'' This subfamily also contains the extinct genera ''Xenothrix Antillothrix'' ''Paralouatta Carlocebus Lagonimico'' and possibly also ''Tremacebus''.

Titis live in South America from Colombia to Brazil Bolivia Peru and northern Paraguay.

Depending on species titis have a head and body length of  and a tail which is longer than the head and body of . The different titi species vary substantially in coloring but resemble each other in most other physical ways. They have long soft fur and it is usually reddish brownish grayish or blackish and in most species the underside is lighter or more rufescent than the upperside. Some species have contrasting blackish or whitish foreheads while all members of the genus ''Cheracebus'' have a white half-collar. The tail is always furry and is not prehensile.

Diurnal and arboreal titis predominantly prefer dense forests near water. They easily jump from branch to branch earning them their German name ''Springaffen'' (jumping monkeys). They sleep at night but can also take a midday nap.

Titis are territorial. They live in family groups that consist of parents and their offspring about two to seven animals in total. They defend their territory by shouting and chasing off intruders but rarely engage in actual fighting. Their grooming and communication is important for the co-operation of the group. They can typically be seen in pairs sitting or sleeping with tails entwined.

The diet of the titis consists mainly of fruits although they also eat leaves flowers insects bird eggs and small vertebrates.

Titis are monogamous mating for life. The female bears a single young after about a five-month gestation. Twins occur rarely having been documented in only 1.4% of all births in captive groups of ''Plecturocebus moloch''. While the second infant usually does not survive cases where neighbouring groups have adopted infants are known suggesting that twins may be reared successfully under certain circumstances. Often it is the father who cares for the young carrying it and bringing it to the mother only for nursing. The young are weaned after 5 months and are fully grown after two years. After three or more years they leave their family group in order to find a mate. While the life expectancy of most species is unclear the members of the genus ''Cheracebus'' may live for up to 12 years in the wild while members of the ''P. moloch'' group have been known to live for more than 25 years in captivity.

418185,Exsurge Domine,Reaction,"
===Reactions by Luther and his sympathizers===

The Pope assigned to Eck and Cardinal Girolamo Aleandro the task of publishing this bull in Saxony its neighboring regions and the Low Countries.

They found this task more difficult than had initially been anticipated on account of the widespread public support for Luther particularly in Germany. At Erfurt students who sympathized with Luther tossed copies of the bull into the local river and at Torgau a posted copy was torn down and defaced. Even some Catholic bishops hesitated as much as six months before publishing the bull's contents. At times the opposition faced by Eck and Aleandro was so fierce that their very lives were endangered. At Leipzig Eck had to retreat for an hour to a cloister in fear for his life.

Eck found his task to be particularly onerous. He had received secret instructions permitting him to include more names under the bull's threat of excommunication at his discretion. This power he chose to exercise by supplementing the bull with the names of several prominent German Humanists and thereby aroused their opposition besides that of Luther's supporters. In the Netherlands Aleandro also experienced his share of confrontations with Luther's sympathizers. Among those he encountered was Desiderus Erasmus who declared that ""The inclemency of the bull ill comports with the moderation of Leo"" and also that ""Papal bulls are weighty but scholars attach much more weight to books with good arguments drawn from the testimony of divine Scripture which does not coerce but instructs.""

For these reasons its dissemination took several months to complete. Luther himself received an official copy bearing the papal seal in early October of that year. However rumors of its existence reached Luther well in advance of the official copy. At first he doubted their veracity and thought that the document to which they referred may be a forgery possibly by Eck himself. Nonetheless he commented that it was the work of Antichrist whatever its true origin may be and started to compose a response even before he had received an official copy. His response was entitled ''Adversus Execrabile Antichristi Bullam'' (Against the Execrable Bull of Antichrist).

Luther defiantly proclaimed in his response that ""...whoever wrote this bull he is Antichrist.  I protest before God our Lord Jesus his sacred angels and the whole world that with my whole heart I dissent from the damnation of this bull that I curse and execrate it as sacrilege and blasphemy of Christ God's Son and our Lord.  This be my recantation O bull thou daughter of bulls.""  He subsequently took issue with the '''' censure of his statements:  ""My articles are called 'respectively some heretical some erroneous some scandalous"" which is as much to say 'We don't know which are which.' O meticulous ignorance!  I want to be instructed not respectively but absolutely and certainly. ... Let them show where I am a heretic or dry up their spittle.""  Much of the remainder of the tract is devoted to a discussion of the censured propositions.

With the publication of the bull sporadic public burnings of Luther's works began to take place in Germany in accordance with Leo X's instructions. However in some places this directive proved impossible or difficult to carry out because of Luther's popular support.  On certain occasions his followers managed to substitute his condemned books with wastepaper or anti-Luther tracts or rescue some of his works from the flames before they were consumed.

On 29 November 1520 Luther published a second response to the bull entitled ''Assertion of All the Articles Wrongly Condemned in the Roman Bull.''  Luther's commentary on proposition #18 provides a representative example of its general tone:  ""I was wrong I admit it when I said that indulgences were 'the pious defrauding of the faithful.'  I recant and say 'Indulgences are the most pious frauds and imposters of the most rascally pontiffs by which they deceive the souls and destroy the goods of the faithful.'""  Luther also published his ''On the Freedom of a Christian'' that same month.  Although this work was not penned as a direct response to the bull it nevertheless reaffirmed Luther's commitment to certain themes censured therein including the primacy of ecumenical councils over papal decrees.

On 10 December 1520 sixty days after Luther had received a copy of this bull he and Melanchthon invited the local university faculty and students to assemble that morning at the Elster Gate in Wittenberg.  A bonfire was lit and volumes of canon law papal constitutions and works of scholastic theology were burned.  Luther himself tossed a copy of the bull into the flames.  Having done so Luther is reported to have said ""Because you have confounded the truth or the saints of God today the Lord confounds you. Into the fire with you!"" a declaration which alludes to Psalm 21:9. Luther's act of defiance reflected deeper motives than a mere retaliatory desire to treat these representations of Catholic authority with the same regard that the papal bull had shown for his own books.  By burning these works Luther signaled his decisive break from Catholicism's traditions and institutions.  Luther himself later explained his actions that day:

Since they have burned my books I burn theirs.  The canon law was included because it makes the pope a god on earth.  So far I have merely fooled with this business of the pope.  All my articles condemned by Antichrist are Christian.  Seldom has the pope overcome anyone with Scripture and with reason.

The breach between Luther and the papacy was finalized on 3 January 1521 when on account of Luther's failure to comply the Pope issued the bull ''Decet Romanum Pontificem'' to declare that he had been formally excommunicated.

===Modern reactions===

'''' marks a watershed event in Christian history.  Protestant author Philip Schaff notes that ""The bull of excommunication is the papal counter-manifesto to Luther's Theses and condemns in him the whole cause of the Protestant Reformation.  Therein lies its historical significance.  It was the last bull addressed to Latin Christendom as an undivided whole and the first which was disobeyed by a large part of it.""

However contemporary scholars of the Reformation widely agree that this bull itself is a ""strange document and an evasive assessment of Luther's theological concerns."" Schaff notes that the condemned propositions are ""torn from the connection context and presented in the most objectionable form as mere negations of Catholic doctrines.  The positive views of the Reformer are not stated or distorted."" Catholic author John M. Todd calls the bull ""contradictory lacking in charity and incidentally far less effective than it might have been.""  Not only does the text fail to identify precisely how each proposition is censured but also it avoids direct engagement with numerous issues that are central to Luther's theology including Sola Fide and Sola Scriptura.  In part this evasion was simply an unavoidable consequence of the fact that Luther did not fully articulate his mature theological position until some time after this bull had been issued.  Even so Eck did not afford the committee sufficient time to better grasp the core issues at stake in Luther's teachings.  As a result some of the censured propositions are ambiguous peripheral to Luther's main concerns or were misunderstood or misrepresented by the committee.  At least twelve of the forty-one propositions fail to accurately quote Luther or misrepresent his beliefs. The bull itself contains an internal contradiction:  at one point it orders all of Luther's works to be burned but elsewhere restricts this censorship only to those works which contain one of the forty-one censored propositions.

The censure of certain theological propositions in this bull continues to be a source of controversy.  For example proposition #33 censured by this bull states ""It is contrary to the will of the Spirit that heretics be burned.""  something more recent Catholic teaching particularly in regards to the declaration of Vatican II that ""the human person has a right to religious freedom"" and that ""This freedom means that all men are to be immune from coercion on the part of individuals or of social groups and of any human power in such wise that no one is to be forced to act in a manner contrary to his own beliefs whether privately or publicly whether alone or in association with others within due limits"" seems to have softened.  This tension between these two authoritative sources of Catholic teaching has sparked a contemporary debate on papal infallibility however Vatican II's declaration on religious freedom is not absolute but only ""within due limits"" which is subject to a ""just public order.""

Eastern Orthodox author Laurent Cleenewerck asserts that Leo X's condemnations technically satisfy the requirements of an infallible (ex cathedra) definition in accordance with the criteria laid down by Vatican I. The declaration of Leo X that members of the Catholic faithful must ""condemn reprobate and reject completely each of these theses or errors"" on pain of an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication is claimed to constitute an authoritative papal definition on doctrinal matters concerning faith and morals which must be held by the whole Catholic Church.  He then notes that the practice of burning heretics poses a ""serious ethical problem"" and thus Cleenewerck finds in '''' support for his conclusion that ""the idea that Papal Infallibility can be presented as independent of any conciliar consent and as 'the constant belief of the universal Church' is rejected.""

Others disagree with these assessments and advance the alternative view that a censure which may be heretical but may also be merely ""scandalous"" ""offensive to pious ears"" or ""seductive of simple minds"" cannot be accepted as an infallible utterance of the Magisterium.  Brian Harrison argues that a censure of an unspecified nature is potentially subject to future clarification or reform unlike an ex cathedra definition which is by nature irreformable. A second argument advanced here asserts that censures which are merely ""scandalous"" ""offensive to pious ears"" or ""seductive of simple minds"" strongly depend upon a particular context of certain historical or cultural circumstances.  A proposition that causes scandal or offense when it is advanced within a particular context ""may not necessarily be so noxious under different circumstances.""  Even if a proposition is essentially true but poorly worded or advanced in a particular context with the intent of provoking scandal or offense it may be censured as ""scandalous"" or ""offensive to pious ears"".

5806,Forms of government,Introduction,"



A government is the system by which a state or community is controlled. In the Commonwealth of Nations the word ""government"" is also used more narrowly to refer to the collective group of people that exercises executive authority in a state. This usage is analogous to what is called an ""administration"" in American English. Furthermore especially in American English the concepts of ""the state"" and ""the government"" may be used synonymously to refer to the person or group of people exercising authority over a politically organized territory. Finally government is also sometimes used in English as a synonym for governance.

In the case of its broad associative definition government normally consists of legislators administrators and arbitrators. Government is the means by which state policy is enforced as well as the mechanism for determining the policy of the state. A form of government or form of state governance refers to the set of political systems and institutions that make up the organisation of a specific government.

Government of any kind currently affects every human activity in many important ways. For this reason political scientists generally argue that government should not be studied by itself; but should be studied along with anthropology economics environmentalism history philosophy science and sociology.

298763,Harry Potter fandom,Conventions,"Attendees of Sectus convention in London await the midnight release of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''
Fan conventions have been another way that the fandom has congregated. Conventions such as Prophecy LeakyCon Infinitus Azkatraz and Ascendio have maintained an academic emphasis hosting professional keynote speakers as well as keeping the atmosphere playful and friendly. They have featured prominent members of the fandom such as Jennie Levine owner of SugarQuill.net (Phoenix Rising 2007); Melissa Anelli current webmaster of The Leaky Cauldron (Phoenix Rising 2007; Leakycon 2009/2011/2012); Sue Upton former Senior Editor of the Leaky Cauldron (Prophecy 2007); Heidi Tandy founder of Fiction Alley (Prophecy 2007) Paul and Joe DeGeorge of the wizard rock band Harry and the Potters (along with several other more well-known Wizard Rock bands such as The Remus Lupins The Parselmouths Ministry of Magic and The Whomping Willows) (see below) (Prophecy 2007; Leakycon 2009/2011/2012) Andrew Slack founder of The Harry Potter Alliance and StarKid the cast of the fan made musicals ""A Very Potter Musical"" ""A Very Potter Sequel"" and ""A Very Potter Senior Year"".

Still the conventions try to attract the fandom with other fun-filled ''Potter''-centric activities often more interactive such as wizarding chess water Quidditch a showing of the ''Harry Potter'' films or local cultural immersions. Live podcasts are often recorded during these events and live Wizard Rock shows have become a fairly large part of recent conventions. Members of the ''Harry Potter'' cast have been brought in for the conferences; actors such as Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood) and Christopher Rankin (Percy Weasley) along with several others have appeared to give live Q&A sessions and keynote presentations about the series.

In addition to fandom-specific programming LeakyCon 2011 and 2012 have hosted LitDays (as well as incorporating the many fandoms ''Harry Potter'' fans have branched into since the ending of the series). LitDays are full of programming with authors agents and editors. A few key examples are John Green author of the award-winning young adult novels ''The Fault in Our Stars'' and ''Looking For Alaska''; Scott Westerfeld author of the ''Uglies'' series and ''Leviathan''; and David Levithan author of ''Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist'' and ''The Lover's Dictionary''.

These conventions are now incorporating the recently opened theme park The Wizarding World of Harry Potter into their itinerary built inside Universal's Island of Adventure in Orlando Florida. At the ''Harry Potter'' fan conventions Infinitus 2010 LeakyCon 2011 and Ascendio 2012 special events were held at the theme park dedicated to the series. These are after-hours events for convention attendees who purchased tickets to experience and explore the park by themselves. The event included talks given by creators of the park free food and butterbeer and live wizard rock shows inside the park.

759167,White Mountain art,Working in North Conway Franconia and points north,"Horace Wolcott Robbins (1842–1904) ''The Northern Presidentials''
North Conway by virtue of its unique location in the southern Mount Washington Valley was a gathering place for many of the artists.  The artist Asher B. Durand (1796–1886) in a letter to ''The Crayon'' in 1855 described the appeal of North Conway:
""Mount Washington the leading feature of the scene ... rises in all his majesty and with his contemporary patriots Adams Jefferson Munroe sic bounds the view at the North.  On either hand subordinate mountains and ledges slope or abruptly descend to the fertile plain that borders the Saco stretching many miles southward rich in varying tints of green fields and meadows and beautifully interspersed with groves and scattered trees of graceful form and deepest verdure ... where every possible shade of green is harmoniously mingled.""

A favorite spot in North Conway for viewing and painting Mount Washington was Sunset Hill.  Typical for this view in 1858 Champney painted ''Mount Washington from Sunset Hill'' that looks down on his own house and backyard and out across North Conway’s Intervale.  North Conway afforded vantage points for other frequently painted views — Moat Mountain Kearsarge North and Mount Chocorua.  North Conway was also a short distance from two of the three notches of the White Mountains: Pinkham Notch and Crawford Notch.

Many artists also traveled to the third notch Franconia Notch to paint.  A rivalry developed between the Franconia artists and the North Conway artists.  Each faction believed that their location had the most beautiful view of the mountains.  Those who preferred Franconia felt that North Conway as early as 1857 had been overrun by tourists.  Barbara J. MacAdam in her essay ""A Proper Distance from the Hills"" stated: ""To meet this growing demand for tourists railroad lines were extended and new hotels constructed on a grand scale.  In the process those qualities that had drawn artists to North Conway in the first place became endangered.""  Daniel Huntington (1816–1906) writing from West Campton in 1855 described the appeal of the Franconia region to the landscape painter.

:""I find it indeed a very agreeable and desirable place for landscape study ... The Pemigewasset river which winds through the valley is somewhat like the Saco in the vicinity of Conway.  Its banks are mostly of sand occasionally varied by broken masses of rock ... The valley is narrower than that of the Saco and is quite different in the character of its half-wooded hill-sides.""

In the Franconia region artists painted Mount Lafayette Franconia Notch Eagle Cliff and New Hampshire's well-known icon the Old Man of the Mountain.  Edward Hill George McConnell and Samuel Lancaster Gerry all painted the subject of the Old Man. Fewer artists worked in the area north of the Presidential Range.  Those who did painted less well-known scenes from Shelburne Gorham and Jefferson.  These locations were strategically located along train or coach routes from Gorham and Franconia.  ''The Northern Presidentials'' pictured above is one such example of a painting of the Presidential Range from the north.

8291,Kemp Town,Introduction,"



Lewes Crescent and its private gardens.

'''Kemp Town''' is a 19th-century residential estate in the east of Brighton in East Sussex England UK. Conceived and financed by Thomas Read Kemp it has original estate is now demarcated by the modern Kemp Town Conservation Area as defined by the local authority Brighton and Hove City Council.

The estate was designed by Charles Busby and Amon Henry Wilds and constructed by Thomas Cubitt. Building work started in 1823 on Arundel Terrace Chichester Terrace Lewes Crescent and Sussex Square. Chichester Terrace incorporated the earlier Chichester House.  In 1837 Thomas Kemp fled the country to escape his creditors.  The project continued under Cubitt with the support of the Fifth Earl of Bristol.  It was completed in 1855 with Sussex Square larger than London's Grosvenor Square and at the time the biggest housing crescent in Britain.  The original estate is a good example of Regency architecture.

At around the same time Brighton's neighbour Hove was expanding on the western boundary of Brighton with the development of the Brunswick Estate which featured similar though smaller Regency-style properties and its own market police station riding school and (as in Kemp Town) small mews streets for staff housing. These mews now provide very attractive private accommodation which can fetch similar prices to flats in the grand houses they once served.

Below and to the south of Kemp Town at beach level is now Brighton Marina and a proposed redevelopment at Black Rock site of a former lido.

At the time Delft then a Polytechnic did not have the right to confer doctorates so Leiden did this for them. He became a teacher in microbiology at the Agricultural School in Wageningen (now Wageningen University) and later at the ''Polytechnische Hogeschool Delft'' (Delft Polytechnic currently Delft University of Technology) (from 1895). He established the Delft School of Microbiology. His studies of agricultural and industrial microbiology yielded fundamental discoveries in the field of biology. His achievements have been perhaps unfairly overshadowed by those of his contemporaries Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur because unlike them Beijerinck never studied human disease.

In 1885 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

3000,Conservative Judaism,Jewish law,"

===Role===
Fidelity and commitment to ''Halakha'' while subject to criticism as disingenuous both from within and without were and remain a cornerstone doctrine of Conservative Judaism: The movement views the legalistic system as normative and binding and believes Jews must practically observe its precepts like Sabbath dietary ordinances ritual purity daily prayer with phylacteries and the like. Concurrently examining Jewish history and rabbinic literature through the lens of academic criticism it maintained that these laws were always subject to considerable evolution and must continue to do so. ''Emet ve-Emunah'' titled its chapter on the subject with ""The Indispensability of Halakha"" stating that ""''Halakha'' in its developing form is an indispensable element of a traditional Judaism which is vital and modern."" Conservative Judaism regards itself as the authentic inheritor of a flexible legalistic tradition charging the Orthodox with petrifying the process and Reform with abandoning it.

The tension between ""tradition and change"" – which were also the motto adopted by the movement since the 1950s – and the need to balance them were always a topic of intense debate within Conservative Judaism. In its early stages the leadership opposed pronounced innovation mostly adopting a relatively rigid position. Mordecai Kaplan's Reconstructionism raised the demand for thoroughgoing modification without much regard for the past or ''halakhic'' considerations but senior rabbis opposed him vigorously. Even in the 1940s and 1950s when Kaplan's influence grew his superiors rabbis Ginzberg Louis Finkelstein and Saul Lieberman espoused a very conservative line. Since the 1970s with the strengthening of the liberal wing within the denomination the majority in the Rabbinic Assembly opted for quite radical reformulations in religious conduct but rejected the Reconstructionist non-''halakhic'' approach insisting that the legalistic method be maintained. The ''halakhic'' commitment of Conservative Judaism has been subject to much criticism from within and without. Right-wing discontents including the Union for Traditional Judaism which seceded in protest of the 1983 resolution to ordain women rabbis — adopted at an open vote where all JTS faculty regardless of qualification were counted — contested the validity of this description as well as progressives like Rabbi Neil Gillman who exhorted the denomination to cease describing itself as ''halakhic'' in 2005 stating that after repeated concessions ""''our original claim has died a death by a thousand qualifications... It has lost all factual meaning.''""

The main body entrusted with formulating rulings responsa and statues is the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards a panel with 25 voting legalistic specialists and further 11 observers. There is also the smaller ''Va'ad ha-Halakha'' (Law Committee) of Israel's Masorti Movement. Every responsa must receive a minimum of six voters to be considered an official position of the CJLS. Conservative Judaism explicitly acknowledges the principle of ''halachik'' pluralism enabling the panel to adopt more than one resolution in any given subject. The final authority in each Conservative community is the local rabbi the ''mara d'atra'' (Lord of the Locality in traditional terms) enfranchised to adopt either minority or majority opinions from the CJLS or maintain local practice. Thus on the issue of admitting openly Homosexual rabbinic candidates the Committee approved two resolutions one in favour and one against; the JTS took the lenient position while the Seminario Rabinico Latinoamericano still adheres to the latter. Likewise while most Conservative synagogues approved of egalitarianism for women in religious life some still maintain traditional gender roles and do not count females for prayer quorums.

===Characteristics===
The Conservative treatment of ''Halakha'' is defined by several features though the entire range of denominational ''Halakhic'' discourse cannot be sharply distinguished from either the traditional or Orthodox one. Rabbi David Golinkin who attempted to classify its parameters stressed that quite often rulings merely reiterate conclusions reached in older sources or even Orthodox ones. for example in the details of preparing Sabbath ritual enclosures it draws directly on the opinions of the ''Shulchan Aruch'' and Rabbi Hayim David HaLevi. Another tendency prevalent among the movement's rabbis yet again not particular to it is the adoption of the more lenient positions on the matters at question — though this is not universal and responsa also took stringent ones not infrequently.

A more distinctive characterization is a greater proclivity to base rulings on earlier sources in the ''Rishonim'' or before them as far back as the Talmud. Conservative decisors frequently resort to less canonical sources isolated responsa or minority opinions. They demonstrate more fluidity in regards to established precedent and continuum in rabbinic literature mainly those by the later authorities and lay little stress on the perceived hierarchy between major and minor legalists of the past. They are far more inclined to contend (''machloket'') with old rulings to be flexible towards custom or to wholly disregard it. This is especially expressed in less hesitancy to rule against or notwithstanding the major codifications of Jewish Law like ''Mishne Torah'' ''Arba'ah Turim'' and especially the ''Shulchan Aruch'' with its Isserles Gloss and later commentaries. Conservative authorities while often relying on the ''Shulchan Aruch'' themselves criticize the Orthodox for relatively rarely venturing beyond it and overly canonizing Rabbi Joseph Karo's work. In several occasions Conservative rabbis discerned that the ''Shulchan Aruch'' ruled without firm precedent sometimes deriving his conclusions from the ''Kabbalah''. An important example is the ruling of Rabbi Golinkin — contrary to the majority consensus among the ''Acharonim'' and the more prominent ''Rishonim'' but based on many opinions of the lesser ''Rishonim'' which is derived from a minority view in the Talmud — that the Sabbatical Year is not obligatory in present times at all (neither ''de'Oraita'' nor ''de'Rabanan'') but rather an act of piety.

Ethical considerations and the weight due to them in determining ''halakhic'' issues mainly to what degree may modern sensibilities shape the outcome are subject to much discourse. Right-wing decisors like Rabbi Joel Roth maintained that such elements are naturally a factor in formulating conclusions but may not alone serve as a justification for adopting a position. The majority however basically subscribed to the opinion evinced already by Rabbi Seymour Siegel in the 1960s that the cultural and ethical norms of the community the contemporary equivalents of Talmudic ''Aggadah'' should supersede the legalistic forms when the two came into conflict and there was a pivotal ethical concern. Rabbi Elliot Dorff concluded that in contrast to the Orthodox the denomination maintains that the juridical details and processes mainly serve higher moral purposes and could be modified if they no longer do so: ""in other words the ''Aggadah'' should control the ''Halakha''."" The liberal Rabbi Gordon Tucker along with Gillman and other progressives supported a far-reaching implementation of this approach making Conservative Judaism much more ''Aggadic'' and allowing moral priorities an overriding authority at all occasions. This idea became very popular among the young generation but it was not fully embraced either. In the 2006 resolution on homosexuals the CJLS chose a middle path: they agreed that the ethical consideration of human dignity was of supreme importance but not sufficient to uproot the express Biblical prohibition on not to lie with mankind as with womankind (traditionally understood as banning full anal intercourse). All other limitations including on other forms of sexual relations were lifted. A similar approach is manifest in the great weight ascribed to sociological changes in deciding religious policy. The CJLS and the Rabbinical Assembly members frequently state that circumstances were profoundly transformed in modern times fulfilling the criteria mandating new rulings in various fields (based on general talmudic principles like ''Shinui ha-I'ttim'' ""Change of Times""). This along with the ethical aspect was a main argument for revolutionizing the role of women in religious life and embracing egalitarianism.

The most distinctive feature of Conservative legalistic discourse in which it is conspicuously and sharply different from Orthodoxy is the incorporation of critical-scientific methods into the process. Deliberations almost always delineate the historical development of the specific issue at hand from the earliest known mentions until modern times. This approach enables a thorough analysis of the manner in which it was practiced accepted rejected or modified in various periods not necessarily en sync with the received rabbinic understanding. Archaeology philology and Judaic Studies are employed; rabbis use comparative compendiums of religious manuscripts sometimes discerning that sentences were only added later or include spelling grammar and transcription errors changing the entire understanding of certain passages. This critical approach is central to the movement for its historicist underpinning stresses that all religious literature has an original meaning relevant in the context of its formulation. This meaning may be analyzed and discerned and is distinct from the later interpretations ascribed by traditional commentators. Decisors are also far more prone to include references to external scientific sources in relevant fields like veterinarian publications in ''halakhic'' matters concerning livestock.

Conservative authorities as part of their promulgation of a dynamic ''Halakha'' often cite the manner in which the sages of old used rabbinic statues (''Takkanah'') that enabled to bypass prohibitions in the Pentateuch like the ''Prozbul'' or ''Heter I'ska''. In 1948 when employing those was first debated Rabbi Isaac Klein argued that since there was no consensus on leadership within Catholic Israel formulation of significant ''takkanot'' should be avoided. Another proposal to ratify them only with a two-thirds majority in the RA was rejected. New statues require a simple majority 13 supporters among the 25 members of the CJLS. In the 1950s and 1960s such drastic measures — as Rabbi Arnold M. Goodman cited in a 1996 writ allowing members of the priestly caste to marry divorcees ''Later authorities were reluctant to assume such unilateral authority... fear that invoking this principle would create the proverbial slippery slope thereby weakening the entire ''halakhic'' structure... thus imposed severe limitations on the conditions and situations where it would be appropriate'' — were carefully drafted as temporal emergency ordinances (''Horaat Sha'ah'') grounded on the need the avoid a total rift of many nonobservant Jews. Later on these ordinances became accepted and permanent on the practical level. The Conservative movement issued a wide range of new thoroughgoing statues from the famous 1950 responsum that allowed driving to the synagogue on the Sabbath and up to the 2000 decision to ban rabbis from inquiring about whether someone was a Bastard de facto abolishing this legal category.

===Rulings and policies===
a mixed-gender egalitarian Conservative service at Robinson's Arch Western Wall.
The RA and CJLS reached many decisions through the years shaping a distinctive profile for Conservative practice and worship. In the 1940s when the public demanded mixed seating of both sexes in synagogue some rabbis argued there was no precedent but obliged on the ground of dire need (Eth la'asot); others noted that archaeological research showed no partitions in ancient synagogues. Mixed seating became commonplace in almost all congregations. In 1950 it was ruled that using electricity (that is closure of an electrical circuit) did not constitute kindling a fire unto itself not even in incandescent bulbs and therefore was not a forbidden labour and could be done on the Sabbath. On that basis while performing banned labours is of course forbidden – for example video recording is still constituted as writing – switching lights and other functions are allowed though the RA strongly urges adherents to keep the sanctity of the Sabbath (refraining from doing anything that may imitate the atmosphere of weekdays like loud noise reminiscent of work).

The need to encourage arrival at synagogue also motivated the CJLS during the same year to issue a temporal statue allowing driving on that day for that purpose alone; it was supported by decreeing that the combustion of fuel did not serve any of the acts prohibited during the construction of the Tabernacle and could therefore be classified according to their interpretation of the Tosafists' opinion as ""redundant labour"" (''Sh’eina Tzricha L’gufa'') and be permitted. The validity of this argument was heavily disputed within the denomination. In 1952 members of the priestly caste were allowed to marry divorcees conditioned on forfeiture of their privileges as termination of marriage became widespread and women who underwent it could not be suspected of unsavory acts. In 1967 the ban on priests marrying converts was also lifted.

In 1954 the issue of ''agunot'' (women refused divorce by their husbands) was largely settled by adding a clause to the prenuptial contract under which men had to pay alimony as long as they did not concede. In 1968 this mechanism was replaced by a retroactive expropriation of the bride price rendering the marriage void. In 1955 more girls were celebrating Bat Mitzvah and demanded to be allowed ascents to the Torah the CJLS agreed that the ordinance under which women were banned from this due to respect for the congregation (''Kvod ha'Tzibur'') was no longer relevant. In 1972 it was decreed that rennet even if derived from unclean animals was so transformed that it constituted a wholly new item (''Panim Chadashot ba'u l'Khan'') and therefore all hard cheese could be considered kosher.

The 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of women's rights on the main agenda. Growing pressure led the CJLS to adopt a motion that females may be counted as part of a quorum based on the argument that only the ''Shulchan Aruch'' explicitly stated that it consist of men. While accepted this was very controversial in the Committee and heavily disputed. A more complete solution was offered in 1983 by Rabbi Joel Roth and was also enacted to allow women rabbinic ordination. Roth noted that some decisors of old acknowledged that women may bless when performing positive time-bound commandments (from which they are exempted and therefore unable to fulfill the obligation for others) especially citing the manner in which they assumed upon themselves the Counting of the Omer. He suggested that women voluntarily commit to pray thrice a day et cetera and his responsa was adopted. Since then female rabbis were ordained at JTS and other seminaries. In 1994 the movement accepted Judith Hauptman's principally egalitarian argument according to which equal prayer obligations for women were never banned explicitly and it was only their inferior status that hindered participation. In 2006 openly gay rabbinic candidates were also to be admitted into the JTS. In 2012 a commitment ceremony for same-sex couples was devised though not defined as ''kiddushin''. In 2016 the rabbis passed a resolution supporting transgender rights.

Conservative Judaism in the United States held a relatively strict policy regarding intermarriage. Propositions for acknowledging Jews by patrilineal descent as in the Reform movement were overwhelmingly dismissed. Unconverted spouses were largely barred from community membership and participation in rituals; clergy are banned from any involvement in interfaith marriage on pain of dismissal. However as the rate of such unions rose dramatically Conservative congregations began describing gentile family members as ''K'rov Yisrael'' (Kin of Israel) and be more open toward them. The Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism stated in 1995: ""we want to encourage the Jewish partner to maintain his/her Jewish identity and raise their children as Jews.""

259111,Historical fantasy,Introduction,"
''The Accolade'' by British painter Edmund Blair Leighton exhibits an idealized view of history common in historical fantasy. 


'''Historical fantasy''' is a category of fantasy and genre of historical fiction that incorporates fantastic elements (such as magic) into the narrative. There is much crossover with other subgenres of fantasy; those classes as Arthurian Celtic or Dark Ages could just as easily be placed in Historical Fantasy. Stories fitting this classification generally take place prior to the 20th century.

Films of this genre may have plots set in biblical or classical antiquity often with plots based very loosely on mythology or legends of Greek-Roman history or the surrounding cultures of the same era.

The armor is handmade and based on historical artifacts. Unlike most reenactment events the events are not pre-determined. It's a participatory sport; the fighters win or lose a bout much like Karate or Judo.

586502,Nordend (Frankfurt am Main),Introduction,"


'''Nordend-West''' and '''Nordend-Ost''' are two city districts of Frankfurt am Main Germany. The division into a western and an eastern part is mostly for administrative purposes as the '''Nordend''' is generally considered an entity. Both city districts are part of the ''Ortsbezirk Innenstadt III''.

As a whole the Nordend is the second largest district by population in Frankfurt after Sachsenhausen. It is located north of Frankfurt's city centre and borders the Westend to the west the Ostend to the east and Dornbusch and Eckenheim to the north.

The Nordend is popular for its bohemian mix of restaurants cafés and bars. In the 1960s and 1970s the Nordend was one of the centers of the student riots in Germany along with Hamburg and Berlin. The former German foreign minister's Joschka Fischer political career started here as a student leader for the Green Party. In the 2006 local elections Fischer's Green Party became the biggest party in the local district assembly called ""Ortsbeirat"".

Up until today the Nordend has a vibrant mix of artists working-class people students drop-outs gays and lesbians and - as of recently - bankers and consultants. The students of the seventies still live here but they are now best-agers with a high disposable income which they spend in local wine stores and organic grocery stores.

590258,Damien Woody,Professional career,"
===New England Patriots===
The Patriots selected him 17th overall in the first round of the 1999 draft. Woody would go on to start 76 games with the Patriots mostly at center.

Woody was known to struggle with delivering the snap in the shotgun formation.  When a play was called that required a shotgun snap to the quarterback Woody would rotate to the guard position.

As the anchor of a tough and effective New England offensive line Woody was a member of two Super-Bowl-winning teams in 2001 and 2003. He did not play in Super Bowl XXXVIII against the Carolina Panthers because of a knee injury.

===Detroit Lions===
Woody signed as a free agent with the Detroit Lions in March 2004 and started every game in the 2004 and 2005 seasons before missing most of 2006 on injured reserve. His play earned him a selection as a Pro Bowl alternate in 2004.

===New York Jets===
On March 2 2008 Woody and the Jets agreed to a five-year $25 million contract with $11 million in guaranteed money.

During the Jets' post-season run Woody suffered a torn Achilles tendon in a victory over the Indianapolis Colts on January 8 2011. Woody was subsequently placed on the injured reserve list on January 12 2011. Following the injury Woody was released by the Jets on February 28 2011.

Woody announced his retirement on July 26 2011.

===Broadcasting career===
On August 5 2011 he joined ESPN as an NFL analyst. He can be seen on ''SportsCenter'' ''NFL Live'' and other shows.

While some reviewers regard the novel as a thriller others see it as an example of post-millennial science fiction with stories set in the ""technocultural future-present"". Some reviewers note that the novel furthers the post-millennial trend in science fiction of illustrating society's inability to imagine a definitive future and the use of technologies once considered advanced or academic now commonplace within society and its vernacular. Gibson said that the only science fiction elements are ""the Footage and Cayce's special talents"" but that he ""never bought that conceit that science fiction is about the future"". Dennis Danvers explained the use of science fiction as a narrative strategy: science fiction in effect has become a narrative strategy a way of approaching story in which not only characters must be invented but the world and its ways as well without resorting to magic or the supernatural where the fantasy folks work. A realist wrestling with the woes of the middle class can leave the world out of it by and large except for an occasional swipe at the shallowness of suburbia. A science fiction writer must invent the world where the story takes place often from the ground up a process usually called world-building. In other words in a science fiction novel the world itself is a distinctive and crucial character in the plot without whom the story could not take place whether it's the world of Dune or Neuromancer or 1984. The world is the story as much as the story is in the world. Part of Gibson's point ... is that we live in a time of such accelerated change and layered realities that we're all in that boat like it or not. A novel set in the ""real world"" now has to answer the question ""Which one?""

These elements and the use of the September 11 2001 attacks as a breaking point from the past led academics to label it a postmodern novel. The attacks mark the point where the 'modern' that is the 20th-century certainty in society's advancement towards a better future changed to the 'postmodern' that is the 21st-century uncertainty in which future will develop. Fredric Jameson finds Gibson using culture as the determinant of change for the first time with this novel rather than technology. Jameson focuses on the novel's ""postmodern nominalism"" that uses brand names to refresh old objects and experiences.

In post-structural literary theory Cayce is compared with the main character Oedipa Maas of Thomas Pynchon's ''The Crying of Lot 49'' as detectives interpreting clues but with neither the character nor the reader knowing if there actually is a pattern to be found and if there is one whether it is real or  conspiracy. Gibson's use of name-dropping brands to create a sense of ""in-group style … of those in the know"" is traced back to Thomas Pynchon's 1963 novel ''V.'' . Gibson's writing style is said to be similar to Raymond Chandler's detective stories and Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers that used MacGuffins (the identity of the maker of the footage in this case) to drive the story. Gibson's social observations are influenced by the works of Naomi Klein and Malcolm Gladwell.

While markedly different from his previous writing in that it is not set in an imaginary future with imaginary technologies ''Pattern Recognition'' includes many of his previous elements including impacts of technology shifts on society Japanese computer experts and Russian mafia figures. In common with Gibson's previous work Paul Di Filippo found the following in ''Pattern Recognition'': ""the close observation of the culture's bleeding edge; an analysis of the ways technology molds our every moment; the contrasting of boardroom with street; the impossibility and dire necessity of making art in the face of instant co-optation; the damaged loner facing the powers-that-be for both principle and profit"".

There are very few cars on Heligoland. A special section (§50) in the German traffic regulations (''Straßenverkehrsordnung'' abbr. ''StVO'') prohibits the use of automobiles and bicycles on the island. No other region in Germany has any exceptions to the general regulations in the StVO although other North Sea islands such as Baltrum have also banned the public from using cars and motorbikes.

Except for the local ambulance van and the small firetrucks the only motor vehicles on the island are electrically powered and used primarily for moving material. Kick scooters are sometimes used as substitutes for bicycles.

The island received its first police car on 17 January 2006. Until then the island's policemen moved on foot and by bicycle being exempt from the bicycle ban.

341480,Email fraud,Introduction,"

'''Email fraud''' is the intentional deception made for personal gain or to damage another individual through email. Almost as soon as email became widely used it began to be used as a means to defraud people. Email fraud can take the form of a ""con game"" or ''scam''. Confidence tricks tend to exploit the inherent greed and dishonesty of their victims. The prospect of a 'bargain' or 'something for nothing' can be very tempting. Email fraud as with other 'bunco schemes' usually targets naive individuals who put their confidence in get-rich-quick schemes such as 'too good to be true' investments or offers to sell popular items at 'impossibly low' prices. Many people have lost their life savings due to fraud.

On 19 September 1972 a letter bomb delivered to the Embassy exploded killing Ami Shechori an Israeli diplomat. Seven other bombs claimed to have been sent by the terrorist group Black September were either not delivered or detected.

On 3 June 1982 Ambassador of Israel Shlomo Argov was shot and seriously injured on departing an event at the Dorchester Hotel where he was guest of honour. A terror cell claiming to have split from the PLO and headed by Abu Nidal took credit for the attack. After a lengthy coma the Ambassador died of his wounds in 2003. The incident is widely reported as being a key factor in the 1982 Lebanon War.

On 26 July 1994 a car bomb exploded outside the Embassy partially destroying the front of the building and injuring 20 people within and outside the building. The blast damaged shops on nearby Kensington High Street and blew out windows in Kensington Palace. The attack came a day after the leaders of Israel and Jordan had met for peace talks and eight days after a bomb at the AMIA building in Buenos Aires Argentina killed 85 and injured hundreds. Thirteen hours after the attack on the embassy another bomb exploded outside a Jewish charity building in north London injuring six people. Five Palestinians resident in London were arrested in January 1995 in connection with the bombings and two – Jawad Botmeh and Samar Alami – were sentenced to 20 years in jail for their role in the attacks.

A series of demonstrations outside the Embassy during December 2008 and January 2009 held in protest at Israel's ""Cast Lead"" operation in Gaza were marred by violence and ended in a number of arrests and at least one court sentence for those taking part in the violence.

;names in homonymic genus 
In 1783 Johann Gerhard Koenig used the name ''Hura'' to refer to a very different plant from the one Linnaeus had named. Thus was created an illegitimate homonym. Under the rules of nomenclature Koenig's name had to be abandoned. The two names created using his genus are now in the genus ''Globba'' as follows:
# ''Hura koenigii - Globba pendula (Zingiberaceae)''
# ''Hura siamensium - Globba pendula (Zingiberaceae)''

It is the capital of Mountain Province Philippines. 

Bontoc is the historical capital of the entire Cordillera region since the inception of governance in the Cordillera. The municipality celebrates annual Lang-ay Festival.

Bontoc is home to the Bontoc Tribe a feared war-like group of indigenous people who actively indulged in tribal wars with its neighbours until the 1930s. Every Bontoc male had to undergo a rites of passage into manhood which may include head hunting where the male has to journey (Sometimes with companions) and hunt for a human head. The Bontocs also used the jaw of the hunted head as a handle for its gongs and as late as the early 1990s evidence of this practice can be seen from one of the gongs in Pukisan Bontoc. The town also hosts the UNESCO tentatively-listed Alab petroglyphs.

This is the home of the ''Ifuntok'' Language which has variable dialects under it. However the Original ''Ifuntok'' Language is fast dying out as more of the younger generations speak a mixture of ''Ilocano'' ''Tagalog'' and ''Kankanaey'' Dialects. This is partly due to the frequent contact of the younger generations with other regions of the Philippine nation. Some words are not in use anymore. Within the Bontoc proper only 40% of the local population can communicate using this language without diluting their daily language with other languages/dialects.

Areas of the world with tropical climates

The '''tropics''' are a region of the Earth surrounding the Equator. They are delimited in latitude by the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere at  N and the Tropic of Capricorn in
the Southern Hemisphere at  S; these latitudes correspond to the axial tilt of the Earth. The tropics are also referred to as the '''tropical zone''' and the '''torrid zone''' (see geographical zone). The tropics include all the areas on the Earth where the Sun contacts the zenith a point directly overhead at least once during the solar year (which is a subsolar point).

The tropics are distinguished from the other climatic and biomatic regions of Earth which are the middle latitudes and the polar regions on either side of the equatorial zone.

The Tropics comprise 40% of the Earth's surface area and contain 36% of the Earth's landmass. the region is home to 40% of the world population and this figure is projected to reach 50% by the late 2030s.

The Dodge Stratus was introduced in early 1995 with two trims: ''base'' (later renamed ''SE'' for 2000) which came standard with the 2.0 L I4 or optional 2.4 L; and the '''ES''' which came standard with the a 2.0 L from 1994–1997 and had a DOHC 2.4 L and a 2.5 L V6 as optional. In 1998 the 2.4 L was standard and the 2.5 L V6 was optional on the ES and from 1999–2000 the 2.5 L V6 was the only engine on the ES model.

The Stratus directly replaced the high-volume Spirit and Dynasty (United States only) to favorable reviews but lower sales.

Mexico:
A turbocharged version of the Stratus was sold in Mexico with the 2.4 L DOHC 4-cylinder engine and a 4-speed automatic transmission with AutoStick. This engine produced  at 5200 rpm and  of torque at 2200 rpm.

In 2000 the Stratus was available for its last year of sales in Canada with the Chrysler Sebring taking over as the company's only lower mid-size sedan - Dodge did not sell the equivalent version in Canada.

===Chrysler Stratus===
The Stratus was marketed as the '''Chrysler Stratus''' in markets that the Dodge name was not used; such as Europe Argentina and Brazil. In Brazil the Stratus had the same engines as the North American version but a higher ground clearance for the road conditions there. In Europe only the 2.0 L 4-cylinder engine or the 2.5 L V6 engine were available. The European version also had chrome accent moldings along the doors and bumpers.

The '''Base''' was very well-equipped with standard equipment such as: a 2.0L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine a five-speed manual transmission fifteen-inch black steel wheels with plastic wheel covers an A/M-F/M stereo with four speakers air conditioning manual windows and door locks cloth seats and a full instrument cluster. 

SE: The '''SE''' was the least expensive trim level of Stratus in 2000. The '''SE''' included the exact same standard equipment as the previously-base '''Base''' trim level of Stratus.

ES: The '''ES''' was the top-of-the-line trim level of Stratus from 1995-2000. The '''ES''' added the following equipment to the '''Base''' or '''SE''' trim levels: a 2.4L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine a four-speed automatic transmission alloy wheels a premium A/M-F/M stereo with cassette player and integrated CD changer controls with six speakers power windows and door locks keyless entry a power-adjustable driver's seat premium cloth seats and exterior color-keyed side mirrors and door handles.

* The simplest non-trivial Boolean algebra the two-element Boolean algebra has only two elements 0 and 1 and is defined by the rules:

:* It has applications in logic interpreting 0 as ''false'' 1 as ''true'' ∧ as ''and'' ∨ as ''or'' and ¬ as ''not''. Expressions involving variables and the Boolean operations represent statement forms and two such expressions can be shown to be equal using the above axioms if and only if the corresponding statement forms are logically equivalent.

:* The two-element Boolean algebra is also used for circuit design in electrical engineering; here 0 and 1 represent the two different states of one bit in a digital circuit typically high and low voltage. Circuits are described by expressions containing variables and two such expressions are equal for all values of the variables if and only if the corresponding circuits have the same input-output behavior. Furthermore every possible input-output behavior can be modeled by a suitable Boolean expression.

:* The two-element Boolean algebra is also important in the general theory of Boolean algebras because an equation involving several variables is generally true in all Boolean algebras if and only if it is true in the two-element Boolean algebra (which can be checked by a trivial brute force algorithm for small numbers of variables). This can for example be used to show that the following laws (''Consensus theorems'') are generally valid in all Boolean algebras:
:** (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∧ (¬''a'' ∨ ''c'') ∧ (''b'' ∨ ''c'') ≡ (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∧ (¬''a'' ∨ ''c'')
:** (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∨ (¬''a'' ∧ ''c'') ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') ≡ (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∨ (¬''a'' ∧ ''c'')

* The power set (set of all subsets) of any given nonempty set ''S'' forms a Boolean algebra an algebra of sets with the two operations ∨ := ∪ (union) and ∧ := ∩ (intersection). The smallest element 0 is the empty set and the largest element 1 is the set ''S'' itself.

:* After the two-element Boolean algebra the simplest Boolean algebra is that defined by the power set of two atoms:

* The set of all subsets of ''S'' that are either finite or cofinite is a Boolean algebra an algebra of sets.
* Starting with the propositional calculus with κ sentence symbols form the Lindenbaum algebra (that is the set of sentences in the propositional calculus modulo tautology).  This construction yields a Boolean algebra.  It is in fact the free Boolean algebra on κ generators.  A truth assignment in propositional calculus is then a Boolean algebra homomorphism from this algebra to the two-element Boolean algebra.
* Given any linearly ordered set ''L'' with a least element the interval algebra is the smallest algebra of subsets of ''L'' containing all of the half-open intervals ''a'' ''b'') such that ''a'' is in ''L'' and ''b'' is either in ''L'' or equal to ∞.  Interval algebras are useful in the study of Lindenbaum-Tarski algebras; every countable Boolean algebra is isomorphic to an interval algebra.

Hasse diagram of the Boolean algebra of divisors of 30.
* For any natural number ''n'' the set of all positive divisors of ''n'' defining ''a''≤''b'' if ''a'' divides ''b'' forms a distributive lattice. This lattice is a Boolean algebra if and only if ''n'' is square-free. The bottom and the top element of this Boolean algebra is the natural number 1 and ''n'' respectively. The complement of ''a'' is given by ''n''/''a''. The meet and the join of ''a'' and ''b'' is given by the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm) of ''a'' and ''b'' respectively. The ring addition ''a''+''b'' is given by lcm(''a''''b'')/gcd(''a''''b''). The picture shows an example for ''n'' = 30. As a counter-example considering the non-square-free ''n''=60 the greatest common divisor of 30 and its complement 2 would be 2 while it should be the bottom element 1.
* Other examples of Boolean algebras arise from topological spaces: if ''X'' is a topological space then the collection of all subsets of ''X'' which are both open and closed forms a Boolean algebra with the operations ∨ := ∪ (union) and ∧ := ∩ (intersection).
* If ''R'' is an arbitrary ring and we define the set of ''central idempotents'' by  ''A'' = { ''e'' ∈ ''R'' : ''e''2 = ''e'' ''ex'' = ''xe'' ∀''x'' ∈ ''R'' }  then the set ''A'' becomes a Boolean algebra with the operations ''e'' ∨ ''f'' := ''e'' + ''f'' - ''ef'' and ''e'' ∧ ''f'' := ''ef''.

"
147621,Job satisfaction,Models (methods),"
===Affect theory===
Edwin A. Locke’s Range of Affect Theory (1976) is arguably the most famous job satisfaction model. The main premise of this theory is that satisfaction is determined by a discrepancy between what one wants in a job and what one has in a job. Further the theory states that how much one values a given facet of work (e.g. the degree of autonomy in a position) moderates how satisfied/dissatisfied one becomes when expectations are/aren’t met. When a person values a particular facet of a job his satisfaction is more greatly impacted both positively (when expectations are met) and negatively (when expectations are not met) compared to one who doesn’t value that facet. To illustrate if Employee A values autonomy in the workplace and Employee B is indifferent about autonomy then Employee A would be more satisfied in a position that offers a high degree of autonomy and less satisfied in a position with little or no autonomy compared to Employee B. This theory also states that too much of a particular facet will produce stronger feelings of dissatisfaction the more a worker values that facet.

===Dispositional approach===
The dispositional approach suggests that individuals vary in their tendency to be satisfied with their jobs in other words job satisfaction is to some extent an individual trait. This approach became a notable explanation of job satisfaction in light of evidence that job satisfaction tends to be stable over time and across careers and jobs. Research also indicates that identical twins raised apart have similar levels of job satisfaction.

A significant model that narrowed the scope of the dispositional approach was the Core Self-evaluations Model proposed by Timothy A. Judge Edwin A. Locke and Cathy C. Durham in 1997. Judge et al. argued that there are four Core Self-evaluations that determine one’s disposition towards job satisfaction: self-esteem general self-efficacy locus of control and neuroticism. This model states that higher levels of self-esteem (the value one places on his/her self) and general self-efficacy (the belief in one’s own competence) lead to higher work satisfaction. Having an internal locus of control (believing one has control over her\his own life as opposed to outside forces having control) leads to higher job satisfaction. Finally lower levels of neuroticism lead to higher job satisfaction.

===Equity theory===
Equity Theory shows how a person views fairness in regard to social relationships such as with an employer. A person identifies the amount of input (things gained) from a relationship compared to the output (things given) to produce an input/output ratio. They then compare this ratio to the ratio of other people in deciding whether or not they have an equitable relationship. Equity Theory suggests that if an individual thinks there is an inequality between two social groups or individuals the person is likely to be distressed because the ratio between the input and the output are not equal.

For example consider two employees who work the same job and receive the same pay and benefits. If one individual gets a pay raise for doing the same work as the other then the less benefited individual will become distressed in his workplace. If on the other hand both individuals get pay raises and new responsibilities then the feeling of equity will be maintained.

Other psychologists have extended the equity theory suggesting three behavioral response patterns to situations of perceived equity or inequity (Huseman Hatfield & Mile 1987; O'Neil & Mone 1998). These three types are benevolent equity sensitive and entitled. The level by each type affects motivation job satisfaction and job performance.

#Benevolent-Satisfied when they are under-rewarded compared with co-workers
#Equity sensitive-Believe everyone should be fairly rewarded
#Entitled-People believe that everything they receive is their just due

===Discrepancy theory===
The concept of discrepancy theory is to explain the ultimate source of anxiety and dejection. An individual who has not fulfilled his responsibility feels the sense of anxiety and regret for not performing well. They will also feel dejection due to not being able to achieve their hopes and aspirations.
According to this theory all individuals will learn what their obligations and responsibilities are for a particular function and if they fail to fulfill those obligations then they are punished. Over time these duties and obligations consolidate to form an abstracted set of principles designated as a self-guide. Agitation and anxiety are the main responses when an individual fails to achieve the obligation or responsibility.
This theory also explains that if achievement of the obligations is obtained then the reward can be praise approval or love. These achievements and aspirations also form an abstracted set of principles referred to as the ideal self guide. When the individual fails to obtain these rewards they begin to have feelings of dejection disappointment or even depression.

===Two-factor theory (motivator-hygiene theory)===

Frederick Herzberg’s two-factor theory (also known as motivator-hygiene theory) attempts to explain satisfaction and motivation in the workplace. This theory states that satisfaction and dissatisfaction are driven by different factors – motivation and hygiene factors respectively. An employee’s motivation to work is continually related to job satisfaction of a subordinate. Motivation can be seen as an inner force that drives individuals to attain personal and organizational goals (Hoskinson Porter & Wrench p. 133). Motivating factors are those aspects of the job that make people want to perform and provide people with satisfaction for example achievement in work recognition promotion opportunities. These motivating factors are considered to be intrinsic to the job or the work carried out. Hygiene factors include aspects of the working environment such as pay company policies supervisory practices and other working conditions.

While Herzberg's model has stimulated much research researchers have been unable to reliably empirically prove the model with Hackman & Oldham suggesting that Herzberg's original formulation of the model may have been a methodological artifact. Furthermore the theory does not consider individual differences conversely predicting all employees will react in an identical manner to changes in motivating/hygiene factors. Finally the model has been criticised in that it does not specify how motivating/hygiene factors are to be measured.

===Job characteristics model===

Hackman & Oldham proposed the job characteristics model which is widely used as a framework to study how particular job characteristics impact job outcomes including job satisfaction.  The five core job characteristics can be combined to form a motivating potential score (MPS) for a job which can be used as an index of how likely a job is to affect an employee's attitudes and behaviors. Not everyone is equally affected by the MPS of a job. People who are high in growth need strength (the desire for autonomy challenge and development of new skills on the job) are particularly affected by job characteristics.  A meta-analysis of studies that assess the framework of the model provides some support for the validity of the JCM.

403535,HMS Taku,Introduction,"


Two vessels of the Royal Navy have borne the name '''HMS ''Taku''''' after the Taku forts in China.

* The first ''Taku'' was a captured destroyer. Originally built by Schichau at Elbing for the Chinese Navy in 1898 she displaced 305 tons had a speed of  and was armed with six 3-pounder guns and two  torpedo tubes and had 58 crew.  She was one of four captured from the Chinese during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. The four ships were shared between the navies of the UK France Imperial Germany and Imperial Russia and Until the Russian one was renamed ''Lieutenant Burakov'' each was named ''Taku'' (see French ''Takou'' German ''Taku'' Russian ''Taku'').   She displaced 305 tons was 194 feet long and her 6000 HP produced 32 knots courtesy of her Schichau boilers.  The Taku was armed with six three pounders and two torpedo tubes and carried a full complement of 58 officers and men.  The British ''Taku'' was sold in Hong Kong in 1916.
* The second ''Taku'' (N38) was a T-class submarine built by Cammell Laird and launched in 1939.  She served in Second World War and was sold in 1946.

===In U.S. law schools===
Following the Watergate scandal which involved questionable behavior by a number of lawyers the American Bar Association (""ABA"") mandated that all American law schools incorporate a required course on this topic. This is typically offered as an upper-level course most often taken in the second year. Professional Responsibility courses include matters pertaining to basic legal ethics as well as bar admissions legal advertising disbarment proceedings ineffective assistance of counsel and judicial misconduct.

===Examinations concerning professional responsibility===
Every state in the United States tests prospective attorneys on their knowledge of professional responsibility. 47 states and the District of Columbia require bar applicants to pass an exam called the Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam (""MPRE""). The remaining three states test professional responsibility on their local bar examinations. Furthermore the ABA promulgated the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct. in 1983; when Maine adopted the Model Rules in August 2009 California became the only remaining U.S. jurisdiction not to have adopted the Model Rules in whole or in part. Most states have only minor variations from the Model Rules if any. Attorneys who violate professional responsibility rules may be subject to sanctions ranging from reprimands to temporary suspension to permanent disbarment. The responsibility is defined as ''a charge assigned to a unique actor to signify its accountabilities concerning a unique business task''.

In 2002 Coulter was encouraged by the ''Save the Swilly'' organisation to run for Dáil to protect Lough Swilly from aquacultural destruction. After some deliberation he concluded that work and family commitments would not allow him the time necessary to fill the political position.  Around that time Coulter's brother died in a drowning incident in Ireland which also caused Phil to retreat from the music industry for some time.

155770,Tiocfaidh ár lá,Origins,"Although Irish author James Joyce (pictured 1915) used the English-language phrase ""our day will come"" he applied it to the struggles of the Irish for sovereignty.
The English phrase ""our day will come"" has been used in various contexts. ""Our Day Will Come"" a pop song about love was a 1963 hit for Ruby & the Romantics. In the context of Irish politics in James Joyce's ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' the nationalist Michael Davin (based on George Clancy) says Irish freedom fighters ""died for their ideals Stevie. Our day will come yet believe me.""

The Irish phrase ''tiocfaidh ár lá'' is attributed to Provisional IRA prisoner Bobby Sands who uses it in several writings smuggled out of the Maze Prison. It is the last sentence of ''One Day in my Life'' the diary he kept of the 1981 hunger strike in which he died published in 1983. Diarmait Mac Giolla Chríost antedates this to a pamphlet published c.1975–77 by Gerry Adams of his experiences in the Maze. Many republicans learned Irish in prison (a phenomenon known as ""Jailtacht"" a pun on Gaeltacht) and conversed regularly with each other through Irish both for cultural reasons and to keep secrets from the wardens. The Irish language revival movement has often overlapped with Irish nationalism particularly in Northern Ireland. ''Tiocfaidh ár lá'' has been called ""the battle cry of the blanketmen"". The upsurge in republican consciousness in the wake of the hunger strikes also increased awareness of the Irish language in republican areas.

280680,Folsom Street Fair,Beginnings of the Folsom Street Fair,"
The community had been active in resisting the city's ambitious redevelopment program for the South of Market area throughout the 1970s. City officials had wanted to ""revitalize"" the historically blue collar warehouse industrial district by continuing successful high rise development already underway on Rincon Hill.

But as the AIDS epidemic unfolded in the 1980s the community's relative autonomy from City Hall was dramatically weakened. The crisis became an opportunity for the city (in the name of public health) to close bathhouses and regulate bars which they did beginning in 1984.

As these establishments for the leather community were rapidly closing a coalition of housing activists and community organizers decided to start a street fair. The fair would enhance the visibility of the community provide a means for much-needed fundraising and create opportunities for members of the leather community to connect to services and vital information (e.g. regarding safer sex) that bathhouses and bars might otherwise have been situated to distribute.

Thanks to the success of the first Folsom Street Fair the organizers created the Up Your Alley Fair on Ringold Street in 1985. This fair moved to Dore Street (""Dore Alley"") between Howard and Folsom in 1987.

319404,Historia Norwegiæ,Dates,"
Along with ''Ágrip af Nóregskonungasögum'' and the work of Theodoricus monachus ''Historia Norwegiæ'' is considered one of the Norwegian synoptic histories and is thought to have been written at the earliest sometime between 1160 and 1175AD. This dating however is under debate and 1220AD may be more accurate. The text may have been composed somewhere in eastern Norway.

The manuscript was published by Peter Andreas Munch in 1850 as ''Symbolæ ad Historiam Antiquiorem Rerum Norwegicarum''. The standard edition was based on that of Storm (1880) for many years and the first English translation was done by Kunin and Phelpstead (2001).

Leopold was born on 7 April 1853 at Buckingham Palace London. During labour Queen Victoria chose to use chloroform and thus sanctioned the use of anesthesia in childbirth recently developed by Professor James Young Simpson. The chloroform was administered by Dr. John Snow. As a son of the British sovereign the newborn was styled ''His Royal Highness The Prince Leopold'' at birth. His parents named him Leopold after their common uncle King Leopold I of Belgium.

He was baptised in the Private Chapel of Buckingham Palace on 28 June 1853 by the Archbishop of Canterbury John Bird Sumner. His godparents were his first cousin once removed King George V of Hanover; his fourth cousin once removed Princess William of Prussia; his first cousin once removed Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge; and his maternal uncle by marriage Prince Ernst of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.

Leopold inherited the disease haemophilia from his mother Queen Victoria and was a delicate child.  There was speculation during his life that Leopold also suffered mildly from epilepsy like his grand-nephew Prince John of the United Kingdom.

448980,Music of Sicily,General comments,"Sicily is  home to a great variety of Christian music including a cappella devotional songs from Montedoro and many brass bands like Banda Ionica who play songs from a diverse repertoire. Harvest songs and work songs are also indigenous to the agricultural island known as ""Italy's granary"". Sicilian flute music called friscaletto is also popular among traditionalist Sicilians as are Messina's male choirs and the island's  ''""ciarameddi""'' (bagpipes).

Franco Battiato Carmen Consoli Fratelli Mancuso and Ciccio Busacca are among the most popular musicians from Sicily. Busacca has worked with Dario Fo like many Italian musicians but is perhaps best known for his setting the poems of Ignazio Buttitta a poet who wrote in Sicilian. Fratelli Mancuso (with brothers Enzo and Lorenzo Mancuso) have fused traditional Sicilian peasant songs (lamentazioni) monodic chants (alla carrettiera) and other indigenous forms to create a uniquely Sicilian modern song style.

Sicily has the most vibrant jazz scene in Italy based in Palermo and including Enzo Rao and his group Shamal who have added native Sicilian and Arab influences to American jazz. Sicily is also home to Franco Battiato a popular musician and composer who fused rock and roll with traditional and classical influences beginning with 1979's ''L'era del cinghiale bianco'' a popular landmark album. Pop Classical Crossover soundtrack queen Romina Arena hails from Sicily. She has not only recorded in her Sicilian/Italian languages but recorded and released recordings in many other languages including English Japanese Spanish and French worldwide.

The initial theatrical release was edited down to just under two hours against Spielberg's wishes. After the success of his 1980 ""Special Edition"" of ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' Spielberg was given permission to create his own ""extended cut"" of ''1941'' to represent his original director's cut. This was done for network television (it was only shown on ABC once but it was seen years later on The Disney Channel). It was first released on VHS and Betamax in 1980 from MCA Videocasette Inc. and from MCA Home Video in 1986 and 1990. A similar extended version (with additional footage and a few subtle changes) was released on LaserDisc in 1995. It included a 101-minute documentary featuring interviews with Spielberg executive producer John Milius writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale editor Michael Kahn composer John Williams and others involved. This set also included an isolated music score three theatrical trailers deleted scenes photo galleries and reviews of the movie. This cut was later released on VHS in 1998and later on DVD in 1999. The DVD includes all features from the 1995 Laserdisc Set. It was released again on DVD in 2000 in a John Belushi box set along with the collector's editions of ''Animal House'' and ''The Blues Brothers''.

The temple was first built in 515 during the Liang dynasty (502-557). It used to lie at the northeast foot of the Purple Mountain i.e. where the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum is located since the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) chose the place to be his mausoleum and then the temple was moved to the present place. The temple was named by the Hongwu Emperor himself. It used to be large and covered an area of over 300000 square metres. Later it was destroyed in warfare during the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor in the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) and rebuilt during the reign of the Tongzhi Emperor. In the temple except for buddhas and bodhisattvas Xuanzang and his relics were enshrined and worshipped.

===Wuliang Hall===
Beamless Hall

Wuliang Hall or Beamless Hall was constructed in 1381 and is 22 metres high and 53.8 metres wide. The hall enjoys high reputation for its special architectural techniques. It has three archways on the front and rear sides respectively. The structure was built with bricks from the bottom to the top entirely without a piece of wood or a single nail. Thus it was called Wuliang Hall since Wuliang means beamless. It happens that the hall originally enshrined Amitābha (the Buddha of Infinite Light) whose Chinese name is similar to ""Wuliang"". Later in 1928 the hall was turned into a memorial hall for soldiers who lost their lives in the Northern Expedition (1926–1928). More than 30000 soldiers were enshrined.

===Linggu Pagoda===
Linggu Pagoda is not connected with the temple but was designed by American architect Henry K Murphy and built between 1930 and 1932 as a sign of remembrance for the soldiers. The nine-stories tall pagoda stands 60.5 metres high. Speeches made by Sun Yat-sen and epigraphs of Chiang Kai-shek were inscribed on the tower.

In the temple there is also a Three Superb Tablet on which a painting of Baozhi painted by Wu Daozi a famous painter; a memorial poem written by Li Bai a Tang dynasty poet; calligraphy written by Yan Zhenqing a well-known Tang dynasty calligrapher is inscribed. Since the three were all masters in their own field in the Tang dynasty the tablet was considered Three Superb Tablet. Unfortunately the original tablet was broken in warfare the present one is a duplicate made during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor in the Qing dynasty.

Edward Stratemeyer himself is believed to have written the first volume in its original form in 1904. When the original series was brought to its conclusion in 1979 it had reached a total of 72 volumes. At least two attempts to restart the series were launched after this but neither effort saw the popularity that the original series achieved.

Speculation that Stratemeyer also wrote the second and third volumes of the series is believed to be incorrect; these books are now attributed to Lilian Garis wife of Howard Garis who is credited with volumes 4–28 and 41. Elizabeth Ward is credited with volumes 29–35 while Harriet Stratemeyer Adams is credited with 36–38 39 (with Camilla McClave) 40 42 43 (with Andrew Svenson) and 44–48.

457813,Continuous production,Common processess,"
Some common continuous processes are the following:
*Oil refining
*Chemicals
*Synthetic fibers
*Fertilizers
*Pulp and paper
*Blast furnace (iron)
*Metal smelting
*Power stations
*Natural gas processing
*Sanitary waste water treatment
*Continuous casting of steel
*Rotary kilns for calcining lime or cement
*Float glass

Production workers in continuous production commonly work in rotating shifts.

Processes are operated continuously for practical as well as economic reasons.  Most of these industries are very capital intensive and the management is therefore very concerned about lost operating time.

Shutting down and starting up many continuous processes typically results in off quality product that must be reprocessed or disposed of.  Many tanks vessels and pipes cannot be left full of materials because of unwanted chemical reactions settling of suspended materials or crystallization or hardening of materials.  Also cycling temperatures and pressures from starting up and shutting down certain processes (line kilns boilers blast furnaces pressure vessels etc.) may cause metal fatigue or other wear from pressure or thermal cycling.

In the more complex operations there are sequential shut down and start up procedures that must be carefully followed in order to protect personnel and equipment.  Typically a start up or shut down will take several hours.
 
Continuous processes use process control to automate and control operational variables such as flow rates tank levels pressures temperatures and machine speeds.

1369,Attribution of recent climate change,Non-consensus views,"Contribution of natural factors and human activities to radiative forcing of climate change. Radiative forcing values are for the year 2005 relative to the pre-industrial era (1750). The contribution of solar irradiance to radiative forcing is 5% the value of the combined radiative forcing due to increases in the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide.



Habibullo Abdussamatov (2004) head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia has argued that the sun is responsible for recently observed climate change. Journalists for news sources canada.com (Solomon 2007b) National Geographic News (Ravillious 2007) and LiveScience (Than 2007) reported on the story of warming on Mars. In these articles Abdussamatov was quoted. He stated that warming on Mars was evidence that global warming on Earth was being caused by changes in the sun.

Ravillious (2007) quoted two scientists who disagreed with Abdussamatov: Amato Evan a climate scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US and Colin Wilson a planetary physicist at Oxford University in the UK. According to Wilson ""Wobbles in the orbit of Mars are the main cause of its climate change in the current era"" (see also orbital forcing). Than (2007) quoted Charles Long a climate physicist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratories in the US who disagreed with Abdussamatov.

Than (2007) pointed to the view of Benny Peiser a social anthropologist at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK. In his newsletter Peiser had cited a blog that had commented on warming observed on several planetary bodies in the Solar system. These included Neptune's moon Triton Jupiter Pluto and Mars. In an e-mail interview with Than (2007) Peiser stated that:""I think it is an intriguing coincidence that warming trends have been observed on a number of very diverse planetary bodies in our solar system (...) Perhaps this is just a fluke.""Than (2007) provided alternative explanations of why warming had occurred on Triton Pluto Jupiter and Mars.

The US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA 2009) responded to public comments on climate change attribution. A number of commenters had argued that recent climate change could be attributed to changes in solar irradiance. According to the US EPA (2009) this attribution was not supported by the bulk of the scientific literature. Citing the work of the IPCC (2007) the US EPA pointed to the low contribution of solar irradiance to radiative forcing since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Over this time period (1750 to 2005) the estimated contribution of solar irradiance to radiative forcing was 5% the value of the combined radiative forcing due to increases in the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide (see graph opposite).

===Effect of cosmic rays===
Henrik Svensmark has suggested that the magnetic activity of the sun deflects cosmic rays and that this may influence the generation of cloud condensation nuclei and thereby have an effect on the climate. The website ScienceDaily reported on a 2009 study that looked at how past changes in climate have been affected by the Earth's magnetic field. Geophysicist Mads Faurschou Knudsen who co-authored the study stated that the study's results supported Svensmark's theory. The authors of the study also acknowledged that  plays an important role in climate change.

====Consensus view on cosmic rays====
The view that cosmic rays could provide the mechanism by which changes in solar activity affect climate is not supported by the literature. Solomon ''et al.'' (2007) state:.. the cosmic ray time series does not appear to correspond to global total cloud cover after 1991 or to global low-level cloud cover after 1994. Together with the lack of a proven physical mechanism and the plausibility of other causal factors affecting changes in cloud cover this makes the association between galactic cosmic ray-induced changes in aerosol and cloud formation controversial

Studies by Lockwood and Fröhlich (2007) and Sloan and Wolfendale (2008) found no relation between warming in recent decades and cosmic rays. Pierce and Adams (2009) used a model to simulate the effect of cosmic rays on cloud properties. They concluded that the hypothesized effect of cosmic rays was too small to explain recent climate change. Pierce and Adams (2009) noted that their findings did not rule out a possible connection between cosmic rays and climate change and recommended further research.

Erlykin ''et al.'' (2009) found that the evidence showed that connections between solar variation and climate were more likely to be mediated by direct variation of insolation rather than cosmic rays and concluded: ""Hence within our assumptions the effect of varying solar activity either by direct solar irradiance or by varying cosmic ray rates must be less than 0.07 °C since 1956 i.e. less than 14% of the observed global warming."" Carslaw (2009) and Pittock (2009) review the recent and historical literature in this field and continue to find that the link between cosmic rays and climate is tenuous though they encourage continued research. US EPA (2009) commented on research by Duplissy ''et al.'' (2009):The CLOUD experiments at CERN are interesting research but do not provide conclusive evidence that cosmic rays can serve as a major source of cloud seeding. Preliminary results from the experiment (Duplissy et al. 2009) suggest that though there was some evidence of ion mediated nucleation for most of the nucleation events observed the contribution of ion processes appeared to be minor. These experiments also showed the difficulty in maintaining sufficiently clean conditions and stable temperatures to prevent spurious aerosol bursts. There is no indication that the earlier Svensmark experiments could even have matched the controlled conditions of the CERN experiment.

===Vedas===
Agastya is mentioned in all the four Vedas of Hinduism and is a character in the Brahmanas Aranyakas Upanishads epics and many Puranas. He is the author of hymns 1.165 to 1.191 of the ''Rigveda'' (~1200 BCE). He ran a Vedic school (''gurukul'') as evidenced by hymn 1.179 of the ''Rigveda'' which credits its author to be his wife Lopamudra and his students. He was a respected sage in the Vedic era as many other hymns of the ''Rigveda'' composed by other sages refer to Agastya. The hymns composed by Agastya are known for verbal play and similes puzzles and puns and striking imagery embedded within his spiritual message.



His Vedic poetry is particularly notable for two themes. In one set of hymns Agastya describes a conflict between two armies led by gods Indra and Maruts which scholars such as G. S. Ghurye have interpreted as an allegory of a conflict between Arya (Indra) and Dasa (Rudra). Agastya successfully reconciles their conflict makes an offering wherein he prays for understanding and loving-kindness between the two. Twenty one out of the twenty seven hymns he composed in Mandala 1 of the ''Rigveda'' have his signature ending wherein he appeals ""may each community know refreshment (food) and lively waters"". These ideas have led him to be considered as a protector of both the Arya and the Dasa. However some scholars interpret the same hymns to be an allegory for any two conflicting ideologies or lifestyles because Agastya never uses the words Arya or Dasa and only uses the phrase ''ubhau varnav'' (literally ""both colors""). The theme and idea of ""mutual understanding"" as a means for lasting reconciliation along with Agastya's name reappears in section 1.2.2 of the ''Aitareya Aranyaka'' of Hinduism.

The second theme famous in the Hinduism literature is a discussion between his wife Lopamudra and him about the human tension between the monastic solitary pursuit of spirituality versus the responsibility of a householder's life and raising a family. Agastya argues that there are many ways to happiness and liberation while Lopamudra presents her arguments about the nature of life time and the possibility of both. She successfully seduces Agastya in the simile filled Rigvedic hymn 1.179.

Agastya is mentioned in both the oldest and the youngest layers of the ''Rigveda'' (c. 1500–1200 BCE) such as in hymn 33 of mandala 7 which is older than mandala 1. He is also mentioned in other three Vedas and the Vedanga literature such as in verses 5.13–14 of the ''Nirukta''. Agastya and his ideas are cited in numerous other Vedic texts such as section 7.5.5 of ''Taittiriya Samhita'' 10.11 of ''Kathaka Samhita'' 2.1 of ''Maitrayani Samhita'' 5.16 of ''Aitareya Brahmana'' 2.7.11 of ''Taittiriya Brahmana'' and 21.14 of ''Pancavimsati Brahmana''.

===Ramayana===
12th century statue of Agastya from Bihar.
Sage Agastya is mentioned in the Hindu epic ''Ramayana'' in several chapters with his hermitage described to be on the banks of river Godavari.

In the ''Ramayana'' Agastya and Lopamudra are described as living in Dandaka forest on the southern slopes of Vindhya mountains. Rama praises Agastya as the one who can do what gods find impossible. He is described by Rama as the sage who asked Vindhya mountains to lower themselves so that Sun Moon and living beings could easily pass over it. He is also described as the sage who used his Dharma powers to kill demons Vatapi and Ilwala after they had jointly misled and destroyed 9000 men.

Agastya according to the ''Ramayana'' is a unique sage who is short and heavy in build but by living in the south he balances the powers of Shiva and the weight of Kailasha and Mount Meru. Agastya and his wife meet Rama Sita and Lakshmana. He gives them a divine bow and arrow describes the evil nature of Ravana and according to William Buck B. A. van Nooten and Shirley Triest bids them goodbye with the advice ""Rama demons do not love men therefore men must love each other"".

===Mahabharata===
The story of Agastya is mirrored in the second major Hindu epic ''Mahabharata''. However instead of Rama the story is told as a conversation between Vaisampayana and Lomasa in section 33 of Book 3 the ''Vana Parva'' (the Book of Forest).

Maharishi Agastya drinking the whole sea
He is described in the epic as a sage with enormous powers of ingestion and digestion. Agastya once again stops the Vindhya mountains from growing and lowers them and he kills the demons Vatapi and Ilvala much the same mythical way as in the ''Ramayana''. The ''Vana Parva'' also describes the story of Lopamudra and Agastya getting engaged and married. It also contains the mythical story of a war between Indra and Vritra where all the demons hide in the sea gods requesting Agastya for help who then goes and drinks up the ocean thereby revealing all the demons to the gods.

===Puranas===
The Puranic literature of Hinduism has numerous stories about Agastya more elaborate more fantastical and inconsistent than the mythologies found in Vedic and Epics literature of India. For example chapter 61 of the ''Matsya Purana'' chapter 22 of ''Padma Purana'' and seven other Maha Puranas tell the entire biography of Agastya. Some list him as one of the ''Saptarishi'' (seven great rishi) while in others he is one of the eight or twelve extraordinary sages of the Hindu traditions. The names and details are not consistent across the different Puranas nor in different manuscript versions of the same Purana. He is variously listed along with Angiras Atri Bhrigu Bhargava Bharadvaja Visvamitra Vasistha Kashyapa Gotama Jamadagni and others.

Agastya is reverentially mentioned in the Puranas of all major Hindu traditions: Shaivism Shaktism and Vaishnavism. Many of the Puranas include lengthy and detailed accounts of the descendants of Agastya and other ''saptarishis''.

===Tamil texts===
In Tamil traditions Agastya is considered as the ''father of the Tamil language'' and the compiler of the first Tamil grammar called ''Agathiyam'' or ''Akattiyam''. Agastya has been a culture hero in Tamil traditions and appears in numerous Tamil texts.

There are similarities and differences between the Northern and Southern (Tamil) traditions about Agastya. According to Iravatham Mahadevan both traditions state that Agastya migrated from north to south. The Tamil text ''Purananuru'' dated to about the start of the common era or possibly about 2nd century CE in verse 201 mentions Agastya along with many people migrating south.

In the northern legends Agastya's role in spreading Vedic tradition and Sanskrit is emphasized while in southern traditions his role in spreading irrigation agriculture and augmenting the Tamil language is emphasized. In the north his ancestry is unknown with mythical legends limiting themselves to saying that Agastya was born from a mud pitcher. In southern traditions his descent from a pitcher is a common reference but two alternate southern legends place him as the Caṅkam (''Sangam'') polity and forty ninth generation Velir clan leader who moved from mount Kailasha to south India and alternatively as a descendent from the Yadavas who migrated south.

The northern traditional stories states Mahadevan are ""nothing more than a collection of incredible fables and myths"" while the southern versions ""ring much truer and appear to be a down to earth account of a historical event"". Others disagree. According to K.N. Sivaraja Pillai for example there is nothing in the early Sangam literature or any Tamil texts prior to about the mid 1st millennium CE that mentions Agastya. The earliest mention of the role of Agastya in Tamil language according to Richard Weiss can be traced to the ''Iraiyanar Akapporul'' by 8th century Nakkirar. However in medieval era stories of the Tamil tradition Agastya pioneered the first ''sangam'' period that lasted 4440 years and took part in the second ''sangam'' period that lasted another 3700 years.

The ''Tirumantiram'' describes Agastya as an ascetic sage who came from the north and settled in the southern Potigai mountains because Shiva asked him to. He is described as the one who perfected and loved both Sanskrit and Tamil languages amassing knowledge in both thus becoming a symbol of integration harmony and learning instead of being opposed to either.

====Siddhar====
Agastya in Tamil Hindu traditions is considered as the first and foremost Siddhar (Tamil: ''cittar'' Sanskrit: ''siddha''). A ''siddhar'' is derived from the Sanskrit verbal root ''sidh'' which means ""to accomplish or succeed"". As the first ''Siddhar'' Agastya is deemed as the first master accomplished the sage who perfected his knowledge of the natural and spiritual worlds. This Tamil concept has parallels to Tibetan ''mahasiddhas'' Sri Lankan Buddhist and Nath Hindu yogi traditions of north India.

Agastya along with Tirumular is considered a ''siddhar'' in both philosophical and practical domains unlike most other ''siddhar'' who are revered for their special domain of knowledge. Agastya is also unique for the reverence he has received in historic texts all over the Indian subcontinent.

According to Venkatraman the ''Siddhar''-related literature about Agastya is late medieval to early modern era. In particular all medicine and health-related Tamil text that include Agastya as the ''Siddhar'' have been composed in and after the 15th-century. According to Hartmut Scharfe the oldest medicine siddhar Tamil text mentioning Agastya were composed no earlier than the 16th century.

His named is spelled as ''Agathiyar'' or ''Agasthiyar'' in some Tamil texts and some consider the writer of the medical texts to be a different person.

According to Kamil Zvelebil the sage Agastya ''Akattiyan'' the Siddha and Akatthiyar the author of Akattiyam were three or possibly four different persons of different eras who over time became fused into one single person in the Tamil tradition.

===Buddhist texts===
Several Buddhist texts mention Agastya. Just like early Buddhist texts such as ''Kalapa'' ''Katantra'' and ''Candra-vyakarana'' adapting Panini and Asvaghosa adopting the more ancient Sanskrit poetic methodology as he praises the Buddha Agastya appears in 1st millennium CE Buddhist texts. In Tamil texts for example Akattiyan (another name for Agastya) is described as the sage who learnt Tamil and Sanskrit grammar and poetics from Avalokitan (another name for Buddha-to-be Avalokiteśvara).

The left Indonesian statue shows Agastya with Shiva's trident as a divine sage of Shaivism. Agastya iconography is common in southeast Asian temples.
According to Anne E. Monius the ''Manimekalai'' and ''Viracoliyam'' are two of many South Indian texts that co-opt Agastya and make him a student of the Buddha-to-be.

Agastya elsewhere appears in other historic Buddhist mythologies such as the Jataka tales. For example the Buddhist text ''Jataka-mala'' by Aryasura about the Buddha's previous lives includes Agastya as the seventh chapter. The ''Agastya-Jataka'' story is carved as a relief in the Borobudur the world's largest early medieval era Mahayana Buddhist temple.

===Javanese and southeast Asian texts===
Agastya is one of the most important figures in a number of medieval era Southeast Asian inscriptions temple reliefs and arts. He was particularly popular in Java Indonesia till Islamic wars of conquest overwhelmed the islands of Indonesia. He is also found in Cambodia Vietnam and other regions. The earliest mentions of Agastya is traceable to about the mid 1st millennium CE but the 11th-century Javanese language text ''Agastya-parva'' is a remarkable combination of philosophy mythology and genealogy attributed to sage Agastya.

The ''Agastya-parva'' includes Sanskrit verse (''shlokas'') embedded within the Javanese language. The text is structured as a conversation between a ''Guru'' (teacher Agastya) and a ''Sisya'' (student Agastya's son Drdhasyu). The style is a mixture of didactic philosophical and theological treatise covering diverse range of topics much like Hindu Puranas. The chapters of the Javanese text include the Indian theory of cyclic existence rebirth and samsara creation of the world by the churning of the ocean (''samudra manthan'') theories of the Samkhya and the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy major sections on god Shiva and Shaivism some discussion of Tantra a manual like summary of ceremonies associated with the rites of passage and others.

While the similarities between the ''Agastya-parva'' text and classical Indian ideas are obvious according to Jan Gonda the Indian counterpart of this text in Sanskrit or Tamil languages have not been found in Indonesia or in India. Similarly other Agastya-related Indonesian texts dated to be from the 10th to 12th centuries discuss ideas from multiple sub-schools of Shaivism such as theistic Shaivasiddhanta and monistic Agamic Pashupata and these texts declare these theologies to be of equal merit and value.

Agastya on south side of the 9th-century Javanese Sambisari temple unearthed from volcanic mud.
Agastya is common in medieval era Shiva temples of southeast Asia such as the stone temples in Java (candi). Along with the iconography of Shiva Uma Nandi and Ganesha who face particular cardinal directions these temples include sculpture image or relief of Agastya carved into the southern face. The Shiva shrine in the largest Hindu temple complex in southeast Asia Prambanan features four cellae in its interior. This central shrine within Prambanan group of temples dedicates its southern cella to Agastya.

The Dinoyo inscription dated to 760 CE is primarily dedicated to Agastya. The inscription states that his older wooden image was remade in stone thereby suggesting that the reverence for Agastya iconography in southeast Asia was prevalent in an older period. In Cambodia the 9th-century king Indravarman who is remembered for sponsoring and the building of a large number of historic temples and related artworks is declared in the texts of this period to be a descendant of sage Agastya.

===Agastya Samhita===
The ''Agastya Samhita'' sometimes called the ''Sankara Samhita'' is a section embedded in ''Skanda Purana''. It was probably composed in late medieval era but before the 12th-century. It exists in many versions and is structured as a dialogue between Skanda and Agastya. Scholars such as Moriz Winternitz state that the authenticity of the surviving version of this document is doubtful because Shaiva celebrities such as Skanda and Agastya teach Vaishnavism ideas and the bhakti (devotional worship) of Rama mixed in with a tourist guide about Shiva temples in Varanasi and other parts of India.

===Agastimata===
Agastya is attributed to be the author of ''Agastimata'' a pre-10th century treatise about gems and diamonds with chapters on the origins qualities testing and making jewelry from them. Several other Sanskrit texts on gems and lapidary are also credited to Agastya in the Indian traditions.

===Others===
Other mentions of Agastya include:
*''Bṛhaddevatā in section 5.134.
*The Lalita sahasranama of Shaktism tradition of Hinduism which describes the 1000 names of the goddess Lalita is a part of the ''Brahmanda Purana''. It is presented as a teaching from Hayagriya (an avatar of Viṣṇu) to Agastya.
*Agastya is credited as the creator of the Āditya Hṛdayam (literally ""heart of the sun"") a hymn to Sūrya he told Rama to recite so that he may win against Ravana. Scholars such as John Nuir questioned this hymn since the need for a such a hymn by Rama implies doubts about his divine nature.
*''Lakshmi Stotram'' and ''Saraswati Stotram''.
*The Tamil text ''Pattuppattu'' states Agastya to be master of ''icai'' (music song).

614354,Brake bleeding,Introduction,"Close-up of a disk brake bleed screwVacuum bleeding a disk brake caliperPressure bleeding a brake system

'''Brake bleeding''' is the procedure performed on hydraulic brake systems whereby the brake lines (the pipes and hoses containing the brake fluid) are purged of any air bubbles. This is necessary because while the brake fluid is an incompressible liquid air bubbles are compressible gas and their presence in the brake system greatly reduces the hydraulic pressure that can be developed within the system. The same methods used for bleeding are also used for purging where the old fluid is replaced with new fluid which is necessary maintenance.

The process is performed by forcing clean bubble-free brake fluid through the entire system usually from the master cylinder(s) to the calipers of disc brakes (or the wheel cylinders of drum brakes) but in certain cases in the opposite direction.  A brake bleed screw is normally mounted at the highest point on each cylinder or caliper.

There are four main methods of bleeding: 
*The ''pump and hold method'' the brake pedal is pressed while one bleed screw at a time is opened allowing air to escape. The bleed screw must be closed before releasing the pedal.
*In the ''vacuum method'' a specialized vacuum pump is attached to the bleeder valve which is opened and fluid extracted with the pump until it runs clear of bubbles.
*In the ''pressure method'' a specialized pressure pump is attached to the master cylinder pressurizing the system and the bleeder valves are opened one at a time until the fluid is clear of air.
*In the ''reverse method'' a pump is used to force fluid through the bleeder valve to the master cylinder. This method uses the concept that air rises in liquid and naturally wants to escape up and out of the brake system.

If bleeding brakes because of master cylinder replacement the master cylinder is usually ""bench bled"" before installation. Typically by securing it on the bench filling it with fluid connecting fittings and hoses to route fluid from the outlet ports on the master cylinder back to its reservoir and repeatedly depressing the master cylinder plunger until bubbles are no longer seen coming from the hoses.

Different vehicles have different bleeding patterns. Brakes are usually bled starting with the wheel that is furthest from the master cylinder and working towards the wheel closest to the master cylinder.

215573,Oregon tax revolt,Measure 47 and the rise of Bill Sizemore,"However even with the caps on property taxes the continual increase in property values in Portland exacerbated by the effects of Measure 5 brought higher tax bills for some residents. This led to Bill Sizemore's Measure 47 which attempted to cap the annual rate at which property taxes could rise. Measure 47 also instituted Oregon's double majority rule in which local tax levies could only pass in minor elections when voter turnout surpassed half of the registered voters. In November 1996 Measure 47 was passed by the Oregon voters 52.3% to 47.7%. Problems with the legal wording of Measure 47 caused the Oregon Legislature to send Measure 50 to voters in 1997 which clarified Measure 47. During a special election in May 1997 Measure 50 was approved by the voters 55.7% to 44.3%.

 Order ofmagnitude



===Calculating the order of magnitude===
The order of magnitude of a number is intuitively speaking the number of powers of 10 contained in the number.  More precisely the order of magnitude of a number can be defined in terms of the common logarithm usually as the integer part of the logarithm obtained by truncation.  For example the number  has a logarithm (in base 10) of 6.602; its order of magnitude is 6.  When truncating a number of this order of magnitude is between 106 and 107. In a similar example with the phrase ""He had a seven-figure income"" the order of magnitude is the number of figures minus one so it is very easily determined without a calculator to 6. An order of magnitude is an approximate position on a logarithmic scale.

===Order-of-magnitude estimate===
An order-of-magnitude estimate of a variable whose precise value is unknown is an estimate rounded to the nearest power of ten.  For example an order-of-magnitude estimate for a variable between about 3 billion and 30 billion (such as the human population of the Earth) is 10 billion. To round a number to its nearest order of magnitude one rounds its logarithm to the nearest integer.  Thus  which has a logarithm (in base 10) of 6.602 has 7 as its nearest order of magnitude because ""nearest"" implies rounding rather than truncation.  For a number written in scientific notation this logarithmic rounding scale requires rounding up to the next power of ten when the multiplier is greater than the square root of ten (about 3.162). For example the nearest order of magnitude for  is 8 whereas the nearest order of magnitude for  is 9. An order-of-magnitude estimate is sometimes also called a zeroth order approximation.

===Order of magnitude difference===
An order-of-magnitude difference between two values is a factor of 10.  For example the mass of the planet Saturn is 95 times that of Earth so Saturn is ''two orders of magnitude'' more massive than Earth.  Order-of-magnitude differences are called '''decades''' when measured on a logarithmic scale.

156185,Portuguese Communist Party,History,"

===Origins===
At the end of World War I in 1918 Portugal fell into a serious economic crisis in part due to the Portuguese military intervention in the war. The Portuguese working classes responded to the deterioration in their living standards with a wave of strikes. Supported by an emerging labour movement the workers achieved some of their objectives such as an eight-hour working day.

In September 1919 the working class movement founded the first Portuguese Labour Union Confederation the General Confederation of Labour; however the feeling of political powerlessness due to the lack of a coherent political strategy among the Portuguese working class plus the growing popularity of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia in 1917 led to the foundation of the Portuguese Maximalist Federation (FMP) in 1919. The goal of FMP was to promote socialist and revolutionary ideas and to organize and develop the worker movement.

After some time members of the FMP began to feel the need for a ""revolutionary vanguard"" among Portuguese workers. After several meetings at various trade union offices and with the aid of the Comintern this desire culminated in the foundation of the Portuguese Communist Party as the Portuguese Section of the Comintern on 6 March 1921.

Unlike virtually all other European communist parties the PCP was not formed after a split of a social democratic or socialist party but from the ranks of anarcho-syndicalist and revolutionary syndicalist groups the most active factions in the Portuguese labour movement. The party opened its first headquarters in the Arco do Marquês do Alegrete Street in Lisbon. Seven months after its creation the first issue of ''O Comunista'' (The Communist) the first newspaper of the party was published.

The first congress of the party took place in Lisbon in November 1923 with Carlos Rates as leader. The congress was attended by about a hundred members of the party and asserted its solidarity with socialism in the Soviet Union and the need for a strong struggle for similar policies in Portugal; it also stated that a fascist coup in Portugal was a serious threat to the party and to the country.

===Outlawed===


After the military coup of 28 May 1926 the party was outlawed and had to operate in secrecy. By coincidence the coup was carried out on the eve of the second congress forcing the suspension of party business. In 1927 the party's main office was closed. The party was first reorganized in 1929 under Bento Gonçalves. Adapting the its new illegal status the party reorganized as a network of clandestine cells.

Meanwhile in 1938 the PCP had been expelled from the Comintern. The reason for the expulsion was a sense of distrust in the Comintern caused by a sudden breakdown in the party's activity after a period of strong communist tumult in the country accusations of alleged embezzlement of money carried out by some important members of the party and mainly the weak internal structure of the party dominated by internal wars. The action against the PCP signed by Georgi Dimitrov was in part taken due to some persecution against Comintern member parties or persons (like the Communist Party of Poland or Béla Kun) led by Joseph Stalin. These series of events would in part lead to the end of the Comintern in 1943. The PCP would only reestablish its relations with the communist movement and the Soviet Union in 1947 after sporadic contacts made through the communist parties of Spain and France and later through Mikhail Suslov.

After the 1933 rise of Salazar's dictatorial Estado Novo regime suppression of the party grew. Many members were arrested tortured and executed. Many were sent to the Tarrafal concentration camp in the Cape Verde Islands. This included Bento Gonçalves who would die there. The vast wave of arrests led to a major reorganization in 1940 and 1941 named the ""Reorganization of '40"". The first congress held after these changes was held in 1943 and stated that the party should unite with all those who also wanted an end to the dictatorship. Another important conclusion was the need to increase the party's influence inside the Portuguese army. The party was able for the first time to assure a strong clandestine organization with a network of clandestine cadres which would significantly aid the resistance against Salazar's regime.

In 1945 with the defeat of the major fascist regimes in World War II Salazar was forced to fake some democratic changes to keep up a good image in the eyes of the West so in October of that year the democratic resistance was authorized to form a platform which was named Movement of Democratic Unity (Portuguese: ''Movimento de Unidade Democrática'' or MUD). Initially the MUD was controlled by the moderate opposition but it soon became strongly influenced by the PCP which controlled its youth wing. In the leadership of the youth wing were several communists among them Octávio Pato Salgado Zenha Mário Soares Júlio Pomar and Mário Sacramento. This influence led to the MUD being outlawed by the government in 1948 after several waves of suppression.

The fourth congress held in July 1946 pointed to massive popular struggle as the only way to overthrow the regime and stated the policies that would help the party lead that same popular movement. This along with the consolidation of the clandestine work was the main conclusion of the congress. A brief report of the conclusions of this congress were published by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. At this time Álvaro Cunhal traveled to Yugoslavia with the aid of Bento de Jesus Caraça to improve relations with the Socialist Bloc. Later in 1948 he traveled to the Soviet Union to speak with Mikhail Suslov after which the bonds between the PCP and the International Communist Movement were reestablished. Soon after returning from the Soviet Union Cunhal was arrested by the PIDE.

The fifth congress held in September 1957 was the only congress to be held outside Portugal. In Kiev the Party approved its first programme and statutes. For the first time the party took an official position on colonialism stating that every people had the right of self-determination and made clear its support of the liberation movements in the Portuguese colonies such as MPLA in Angola FRELIMO in Mozambique and PAIGC in Guinea-Bissau.

In January 1960 a group of ten PCP members managed to escape from the high-security prison in Peniche. The escape returned to freedom many of the leading figures of the Party among them Álvaro Cunhal who would be elected in the following year the first secretary-general in nineteen years. Among the escapees was also Jaime Serra who would help to organize a secret commando group the Armed Revolutionary Action (Portuguese: ''Acção Revolucionária Armada'' or ARA). The ARA was the armed branch of the PCP that would be responsible in the 1970s for some military action against the dictatorial regime.

In 1961 the Colonial War in Africa began first in Angola and in the next year in Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau. The war lasted thirteen years and devastated Portuguese society forcing many thousands of Portuguese citizens to leave the country both to seek a better future in countries like France Germany or Switzerland and to escape conscription. The PCP which had been involved in the formation of the nationalist guerrilla movements along with the Soviet Union immediately stated its opposition to the war and its support for the anticolonial movements. The war prompted unrest in Portuguese society and helped lead to the decline of the Salazar regime.

In 1962 the ""Academic Crisis"" occurred. The Salazar regime fearing the growing popularity of democratic ideas among students made several student associations and organizations illegal including the National Secretariat of Portuguese Students. Most members of this organization were intellectual communist militants who were persecuted and forbidden to continue their university studies. With assistance from the PCP the students responded with demonstrations that culminated on 24 March with a large student demonstration in Lisbon. The demonstration was brutally suppressed by the police leading to hundreds of injuries among the protesters. Immediately thereafter the students began a strike against the regime.

In the sixth congress in 1965 Álvaro Cunhal elected secretary-general in 1961 released the report ''The Path to Victory—The Tasks of the Party in the National and Democratic Revolution'' which became a document of major influence in the democratic movement. Widely distributed among the clandestine members it contained eight political goals such as ""the end of the monopolies in the economy"" ""the need for agrarian reform and redistribution of the land"" and ""the democratization of access to culture and education"" — policies that the Party considered essential to make Portugal a fully democratic country. Nine years later on 25 April 1974 the Carnation Revolution occurred putting an end to 48 years of resistance and marking the beginning of a new cycle in the party's life.

===Carnation Revolution===
Legalização do PCP (1974)
Immediately after the revolution basic democratic rights were reestablished in Portugal. On 27 April political prisoners were freed. On April 30 Álvaro Cunhal returned to Lisbon where he was received by thousands of people. May Day was commemorated for the first time in 48 years and an estimated half million people gathered in the FNAT Stadium (now May 1 Stadium) in Lisbon to hear speeches by Cunhal and the socialist Mário Soares. On May 17 the party's newspaper ''Avante!'' produced the first legal issue in its history.

The following months were marked by radical changes in the country always closely followed and supported by PCP. A stormy process to give independence to the colonies started with the full support of the party and within a year Guinea-Bissau Angola Mozambique Cape Verde and São Tomé and Príncipe became independent countries.

Six months after the Carnation Revolution on 20 October 1974 the party's seventh congress took place. More than a thousand delegates and hundreds of Portuguese and foreign guests attended. The congress set forth important statements that discussed the ongoing revolution in the country. The 36 members of the elected central committee had in the aggregate experienced more than 300 years in jail. On 12 January 1975 the PCP became the first legally recognized party.

The revolutionary process continued. On 11 March 1975 the left-wing military forces defeated a coup attempt by rightists in the military. This resulted in a turn in the revolutionary process to the political left with the main sectors of the economy such as the banks transportation steel mills mines and communications companies being nationalized. This was done under the lead of Vasco Gonçalves a member of the military wing who supported the party and who had become prime minister after the first provisional government resigned. The party then asserted its complete support for these changes and for the Agrarian Reform process that implemented collectivization of the agricultural sector and the land in a region named the ""Zone of Intervention of the Agrarian Reform"" or ""ZIRA"" which included the land south of the Tagus River. The PCP took the lead of that process and drove it according to the party's programme organizing thousands of peasants into cooperatives. Combined with the party's strong clandestine organization and support of the peasants' movement during the preceding years in that region these efforts made the south of Portugal the major stronghold of the PCP. The party gained more than half of the votes in Beja Évora and Setúbal in subsequent elections.

One year after the revolution the first democratic elections took place to elect the parliament that would write a new constitution to replace the constitution of 1933. The party achieved 12.52% of the vote and elected 30 members of parliament. In the end as the party wanted the constitution included several references to ""socialism"" and a ""classless society"" and was approved with the opposition of only one party the right-wing Democratic and Social Centre (Portuguese: ''Centro Democrático Social'' or CDS).

In 1976 after the approval of the constitution the second democratic election was carried out and the PCP raised its share of the vote to 14.56% and 40 seats. In the same year the first Avante! Festival took place and the eighth congress was held in Lisbon from 11–14 November. The congress mainly stated the need to continue the quest for socialism in Portugal and the need to defend the achievements of the revolution against what the party considered to be a political step backward led by a coalition of the Socialist Party and the right-wing Centro Democrático Social who opposed the agrarian reform process.

In 1979 the party held its ninth congress which analyzed the state of post-revolutionary Portugal right-wing politics and the party's struggles to nationalize the economy. In December 1979 new elections took place. The party formed the United People Alliance (Portuguese: ''Aliança Povo Unido'' or APU) in coalition with the Portuguese Democratic Movement (Portuguese: ''Movimento Democrático Português'' or MDP/CDE) and increased its vote to 18.96% and 47 seats. The election was won by a centrist/right-wing coalition led by Francisco Sá Carneiro which immediately initiated policies that the party considered to be contrary to working-class interests. Despite a setback in a subsequent election in 1980 in which the PCP dropped to 41 seats the party achieved several victories in local elections winning the leadership of dozens of municipalities in the FEPU coalition. After the sudden death of Sá Carneiro in an air crash in 1980 the party achieved 44 seats and 18.20% of the vote as part of the APU in the 1983 elections. Also in 1983 the party held its tenth congress which again criticized what it saw as the dangers of right-wing politics.

In 1986 the surprising rise of Mário Soares who reached the second round in the presidential election defeating the party's candidate Salgado Zenha made the party call an extra congress. The eleventh congress was called with only two weeks' notice in order to decide whether or not to support Soares against Freitas do Amaral. Soares was supported and he won by a slight margin. Had he not been supported by the PCP he would have probably lost. In 1987 after the resignation of the government another election took place. The PCP now in the Unitary Democratic Coalition (Portuguese: ''Coligação Democrática Unitária'' or CDU) with the Ecologist Party ""The Greens"" (Portuguese: ''Partido Ecologista ""Os Verdes""'' or PEV) and the Democratic Intervention (Portuguese: ''Intervenção Democrática'' or ID) saw an electoral decline to 12.18% and 31 seats.

===Fall of the Socialist Bloc===
In 1988 the PCP held another congress the twelfth in which more than 2000 delegates participated and which put forth a new programme entitled ""Portugal an Advanced Democracy for the 21st Century.""

At the end of the 1980s the Socialist Bloc of Eastern Europe started to disintegrate and the party faced one of the biggest crises in its history. With many members leaving the party called a thirteenth congress for May 1990 in which a huge ideological battle occurred. The majority of the more than 2000 delegates decided to continue the party's ""revolutionary way to Socialism"" — i.e. to retain its Leninist ideology. By so doing it clashed with what many other communist parties around the world were doing. The congress asserted that socialism in the Soviet Union had failed but a unique historical experience several social changes and several achievements by the labour movement had been influenced by the Socialist Bloc. Álvaro Cunhal was reelected secretary-general but Carlos Carvalhas was elected assistant secretary-general.

In the legislative election of 1991 the party won 8.84% of the national vote and 17 seats continuing its electoral decline.

The fourteenth congress took place in 1992 and Carlos Carvalhas was elected the new secretary-general replacing Álvaro Cunhal. The congress analyzed the new international situation created by the disappearance of the Soviet Union and the defeat of socialism in Eastern Europe. The party also traced the guidelines intended to put Cavaco Silva and the right-wing government on its way out a fact that would happen shortly after. In 1995 the right-wing Social Democratic Party was replaced in the government by the Socialist Party after the October legislative election in which the PCP received 8.61% of the votes.

In December 1996 the fifteenth congress was held this time in Porto with more than 1600 delegates participating. The congress criticized the right-wing policies of the socialist government of António Guterres and debated the future of the PCP following the debacle of the Socialist Bloc. In the subsequent local elections the party continued to decline but in the legislative election of 1999 the party increased its voting percentage for the first time in many years. The sixteenth congress was held in December 2000 and Carlos Carvalhas was reelected secretary-general. In the legislative election of 2002 the PCP achieved its lowest voting result ever with only 7.0% of the vote.

In November 2004 the seventeenth party congress elected Jerónimo de Sousa a former metal worker as the new secretary-general.

In the legislative election of February 2005 the Party increased its share of the vote and won 12 of the 230 seats in parliament receiving about 430000 votes (7.60%).

After the 2005 local election in which the PCP regained the presidency of 7 municipalities the party holds the leadership of 32 (of 308) municipalities most of them in Alentejo and Setúbal and holds the leadership of hundreds of civil parishes and local assemblies. The local administration by PCP is usually marked by concern about such issues as preventing privatization of the water supply funding culture and education providing access to sports and promoting health facilitating participatory democracy and preventing corruption. The presence of the Greens in the coalition also keeps an eye on environmental issues such as recycling and water treatment.

The PCP's work now follows the programme of an ""Advanced Democracy for the 21st Century."" Issues like the decriminalization of abortion workers' rights the increasing fees for the health service and education the erosion of the social safety net low salaries and pensions imperialism and war and solidarity with other countries such as Iraq Afghanistan Palestine Cuba and the Basque Country are constant concerns in the party's agenda.

The party has three members elected to the European Parliament after the European election of 2014. They sit in the European United Left–Nordic Green Left group.

Since the 2015 legislative election the Party supports the government of António Costa together with the Left Bloc.

673418,Ronald Ray Howard,Crime,"On April 11 1992 Trooper Bill Davidson stopped Howard originally from the South Park area of Houston Texas on U.S. Highway 59 about 5 miles (8 km) south of Edna Texas in a 1986 GMC Jimmy as his vehicle had a broken headlight. When Davidson approached the driver-side window of the car he was shot in the neck. Howard drove off but was apprehended later in the night with a 9 mm pistol. The car was later found to be stolen. Three days later Davidson died of his injuries. Drug tests showed that Howard had cocaine and cannabis in his system at the time of the murder.

Howard also said that the rap music that he listened to had conditioned him to hate police officers. He had been listening to 2Pac's ""Soulja's Story"" when pulled over. The song talks about the harsh life of a young black male being pulled over by a police officer and then shooting him.

403563,Cesare Pavese,Arrest and conviction; the war in Italy,"Pavese moved in antifascist circles. In 1935 he was arrested and convicted for having letters from a political prisoner. After a few months in prison he was sent into ''""confino""'' internal exile in Southern Italy the commonly used sentence for those guilty of lesser political crimes. (Carlo Levi and Leone Ginzburg also from Turin were similarly sent into ''confino''.) A year later Pavese returned to Turin where he worked for the left-wing publisher Giulio Einaudi as editor and translator. Natalia Ginzburg also worked there.

Pavese was living in Rome when he was called up into the fascist army but because of his asthma he spent six months in a military hospital. When he returned to Turin German troops occupied the streets and most of his friends had left to fight as partisans. Pavese fled to the hills around Serralunga di Crea near Casale Monferrato. He took no part in the armed struggle taking place in that area. During the years in Turin he was the mentor of the young writer and translator Fernanda Pivano his former student at the Liceo D'Azeglio. Pavese gave her the American edition of ''Spoon River Anthology'' which came out in Pivano's Italian translation in 1943.

34311,Napoleon,Memory and evaluation,"
=== Criticism ===
''The Third of May 1808'' by Francisco Goya showing Spanish resisters being executed by Napoleon's troops.

In the political realm historians debate whether Napoleon was ""an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe or instead a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler"". Many historians have concluded that he had grandiose foreign policy ambitions. The Continental powers as late as 1808 were willing to give him nearly all of his gains and titles but some scholars maintain he was overly aggressive and pushed for too much until his empire collapsed.

Napoleon ended lawlessness and disorder in post-Revolutionary France. He was considered a tyrant and usurper by his opponents. His critics  charge that he was not troubled when faced with the prospect of war and death for thousands turned his search for undisputed rule into a series of conflicts throughout Europe and ignored treaties and conventions alike. His role in the Haitian Revolution and decision to reinstate slavery in France's overseas colonies are controversial and affect his reputation.

Napoleon institutionalised plunder of conquered territories: French museums contain art stolen by Napoleon's forces from across Europe. Artefacts were brought to the Musée du Louvre for a grand central museum; his example would later serve as inspiration for more notorious imitators. He was compared to Adolf Hitler most famously by the historian Pieter Geyl in 1947 and Claude Ribbe in 2005. David G. Chandler a foremost historian of Napoleonic warfare wrote in 1973 that ""Nothing could be more degrading to the former Napoleon and more flattering to the latter Hitler. The comparison is odious. On the whole Napoleon was inspired by a noble dream wholly dissimilar from Hitler's... Napoleon left great and lasting testimonies to his genius—in codes of law and national identities which survive to the present day. Adolf Hitler left nothing but destruction"".

Critics argue Napoleon's true legacy must reflect the loss of status for France and needless deaths brought by his rule: historian Victor Davis Hanson writes ""After all the military record is unquestioned—17 years of wars perhaps six million Europeans dead France bankrupt her overseas colonies lost"". McLynn states that ""He can be viewed as the man who set back European economic life for a generation by the dislocating impact of his wars"". Vincent Cronin replies that such criticism relies on the flawed premise that Napoleon was responsible for the wars which bear his name when in fact France was the victim of a series of coalitions which aimed to destroy the ideals of the Revolution.

=== Propaganda and memory ===



Napoleon's use of propaganda contributed to his rise to power legitimated his régime and established his image for posterity. Strict censorship controlling aspects of the press books theater and art was part of his propaganda scheme aimed at portraying him as bringing desperately wanted peace and stability to France. The propagandistic rhetoric changed in relation to events and to the atmosphere of Napoleon's reign focusing first on his role as a general in the army and identification as a soldier and moving to his role as emperor and a civil leader. Specifically targeting his civilian audience Napoleon fostered a relationship with the contemporary art community taking an active role in commissioning and controlling different forms of art production to suit his propaganda goals.

Hazareesingh (2004) explores how Napoleon's image and memory are best understood. They played a key role in collective political defiance of the Bourbon restoration monarchy in 1815–1830. People from different walks of life and areas of France particularly Napoleonic veterans drew on the Napoleonic legacy and its connections with the ideals of the 1789 revolution.

Widespread rumors of Napoleon's return from St. Helena and Napoleon as an inspiration for patriotism individual and collective liberties and political mobilization manifested themselves in seditious materials displaying the tricolor and rosettes. There were also subversive activities celebrating anniversaries of Napoleon's life and reign and disrupting royal celebrations—they demonstrated the prevailing and successful goal of the varied supporters of Napoleon to constantly destabilize the Bourbon regime.

Datta (2005) shows that following the collapse of militaristic Boulangism in the late 1880s the Napoleonic legend was divorced from party politics and revived in popular culture. Concentrating on two plays and two novels from the period—Victorien Sardou's ''Madame Sans-Gêne'' (1893) Maurice Barrès's ''Les Déracinés'' (1897) Edmond Rostand's ''L'Aiglon'' (1900) and André de Lorde and Gyp's ''Napoléonette'' (1913)—Datta examines how writers and critics of the ''Belle Époque'' exploited the Napoleonic legend for diverse political and cultural ends.

Reduced to a minor character the new fictional Napoleon became not a world historical figure but an intimate one fashioned by individuals' needs and consumed as popular entertainment. In their attempts to represent the emperor as a figure of national unity proponents and detractors of the Third Republic used the legend as a vehicle for exploring anxieties about gender and fears about the processes of democratization that accompanied this new era of mass politics and culture.

International Napoleonic Congresses take place regularly with participation by members of the French and American military French politicians and scholars from different countries. In January 2012 the mayor of Montereau-Fault-Yonne near Paris—the site of a late victory of Napoleon—proposed development of Napoleon's Bivouac a commemorative theme park at a projected cost of 200 million euros.

=== Long-term influence outside France ===

Bas-relief of Napoleon I in the chamber of the United States House of Representatives
Napoleon was responsible for spreading the values of the French Revolution to other countries especially in legal reform and the abolition of serfdom.

After the fall of Napoleon not only was the Napoleonic Code retained by conquered countries including the Netherlands Belgium parts of Italy and Germany but has been used as the basis of certain parts of law outside Europe including the Dominican Republic the US state of Louisiana and the Canadian province of Quebec. The memory of Napoleon in Poland is favorable for his support for independence and opposition to Russia his legal code the abolition of serfdom and the introduction of modern middle class bureaucracies.

Napoleon could be considered one of the founders of modern Germany. After dissolving the Holy Roman Empire he reduced the number of German states from 300 to less than 50 prior to the German Unification. A byproduct of the French occupation was a strong development in German nationalism. Napoleon also significantly aided the United States when he agreed to sell the territory of Louisiana for 15 million dollars during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson. That territory almost doubled the size of the United States adding the equivalent of 13 states to the Union.

562912,Cornus canadensis,Taxonomy,"While distinctive as a species itself the generic placement of these plants has differed in various botanical treatments. When the genus ''Cornus'' is taken broadly as done here this species is ''Cornus canadensis.'' However if ''Cornus'' is treated in a narrower sense excluding this species it can instead be classified as ''Chamaepericlymenum canadense'' or as ''Cornella canadensis.''

Where bunchberry a forest species and ''Cornus suecica'' a bog species grow near each other in their overlapping ranges in Alaska Labrador and Greenland they can hybridize by cross-pollination producing plants with intermediate characteristics.

232136,Silver City Highway,Route description,"
The route passes through largely arid terrain although there are multiple irrigated areas between Buronga and Wentworth in the highway's south. There is relatively flat terrain between Wentworth and Broken Hill that forms arid pastures for grazing. Around Broken Hill and a little to the north the Barrier Range is encountered which is more hill than the rest of the route encountered so far but not mountainous. North of there the country is once again relatively flat thought there are further hills around Milparinka. Near Tibooburra the terrain becomes a stony desert this kind of terrain is known in Australia as gibber. There are some unsealed sections of highway north of Broken Hill.

Creeks to the north of Broken Hill are generally crossed straight across the riverbed whether the road has been sealed or not. There is signage to help drivers gauge depth of the waters if there does happen to be flows after rains. The highway also roughly follows the route Charles Sturt took when he explored the area during his search to find the fabled inland sea. The Silver City Highway and its spur are classified as HW22 (Highway 22) by Roads & Maritime Services. The route is signed as B79 between the Abbotsford Bridge in Curlwaa and Broken Hill.

=== Along the Murray River ===
Calder Highway (branch) intersection from the north.
The highway begins at its intersection with the Sturt Highway in the town of Buronga in the far south-west of New South Wales. Buronga is located immediately across the Murray River from the city of Mildura in Victoria. From here the highway heads northwesterly through a pocket of farmland at the locality of Mourquong before turning on a more westerly heading. The road then traverses arid savanna before again reaching the farmland surrounding Dareton. The road takes on the name Tapio Street within the urban area. Continuing west the enters into more farmland at Curlwaa. Here the road comes to a T-insection where a turn to the west is required to stay on the Silver City Highway. The road to the east is also gazetted as a spur of the highway and is signed as the Calder Highway to which it connects a short distance away across the single lane Abbotsford Bridge over the Murray River. Continuing west on the highway the farmland largely continues the entirety of the short distance to Wentworth. Upon entering Wentworth the road takes on several names within the town's urban area. Firstly it takes on the name Wentworth Street before turning west at the Sandwych Street intersection and using that name. The highway then crosses the Darling River over a lift-span bridge. At Adams Street the highway then turns north keeping the name until it leaves the urban area.

=== Wentworth to Broken Hill ===
Terrain as seen from a rest area north of Wentworth
Heading north out of Wentworth the road enters arid scrublands and it swings northwest towards the Great Darling Anabranch. Once it reaches the normally dry river it follows the anabranch upstream crossing it at Bunnerungee Bridge. The road continues to follow the anabranch north passing nearby several normally dry lakes including along the shoreline of Popitah Lake. Roughly following the creekbed of Coombah Creek northwards a short distance the highway then enters the depression of Coombah Lake. The roadway crosses the lakebed atop an embankment. Upon reaching the other side the highway passes Coombah Roadhouse where fuel and supplies can be purchased. From here the highway re-enters the lakebed and continues along it to its northern extent. To the north of Coombah lake the road passes to the west of similarly dry Kudgee Lake the roadway then follows the western side of the Pine Creek creekbed crossing it after some distance then following it along the eastern side much of the remainder of the way Broken Hill. Upon reaching the approaches to Broken Hill the terrain elevation becomes a little more varied from the very flat journey travelled so far as this area is part of the Barrier Range.

=== Within Broken Hill ===
Silver City Highway in Tibooburra looking north
On the southern outskirts of Broken Hill the highway passes Kanandah Road which forms part of the heavy vehicle bypass. North of Kanandah Road the highway takes on the name Wentworth Road for a short distance while it curves eastwards. Once it reaches South Broken Hill urban area the road continues as Patton Street until reach the roundabout at Bonanza Street where it then turns northwards. It passes over a hill between two mines and becomes South Road northward of Gypsum Street. Upon reaching Broken Hill itself; it becomes Crystal Street and then turns north at Iodide Street. North of Argent Street the Barrier Highway also follows the same route for a few blocks until it leaves westwards at William Street. At the same intersection the Silver City Highway heads eastwards. The highway continues east almost all the way until the edge of the city where it turns north at Buck Street. It takes on that name for a short distance until it leaves the urban area.

=== Broken Hill to the Dingo Fence ===
The Highway continues a long distance northwards through very dry country and crossing the occasional creekbed. Eventually it reaches Packsaddle Roadhouse where fuel and supplies can be purchased; roughly halfway between Broken Hill and the Queensland border. North of Packsaddle the road continues in the same fashion although it does pass between some salt lakes. Eventually the road reaches the Milparinka area where the former township can be accessed a short distance off the highway. Further to the north the road reaches Tibooburra the only sizable settlement along the route north of Broken Hill. North of Tibooburra the road passes through the Sturt National Park before reaching its terminus at the Queensland border along the Dingo Fence at Warri Gate.

710359,Hillingdon Hospital,History,"In 1744 Hillingdon Vestry decided to build a workhouse. Finding a suitable site proved difficult but it was finally decided to build it near Colham Green. The work on this was completed in 1747.

By 1830 the workhouse had grown considerably in size and it was decided to expand it to accommodate males and females separately. 

The Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 resulted in the building of the Uxbridge Union Workhouse on the site in around 1838.

Middlesex County Council took charge of the Uxbridge Union buildings in 1930 and began development into the Hillingdon Institution an acute hospital.

Rapid progress was made and the hospital was significantly enlarged in 1932. This included replacing the wooden floors with concrete ones the wooden ones being too weak to cope with the weight of an operating theatre table and equipment.

The hospital was damaged by bombs in October 1940 causing much damage. There were no casualties and the hospital was moved to temporary accommodation. This proved to be unpopular and following the war the number of beds in the hospital declined owing to a lack of staff. The Medical Director of the time Dr W. Arklay Steel was concerned about the condition of the hospital. In 1948 when the NHS took charge the hospital consisted of a series of temporary buildings in varying states of disrepair. 

In 1957 it was agreed to rebuild Hillingdon Hospital. Following this in 1960 the maternity wing of the hospital was opened and is still in operation today. 

Sir Arnold France Secretary of the Ministry of Health opened the current Hillingdon Hospital on 10 January 1967. It had cost £3.2 million to build. It provided seven new wards including the provision of some single rooms outpatients department imaging department accident and emergency services operating theatres and recovery suites pathology laboratories physiotherapy occupational therapy and a canteen. 

It was heralded as being an innovative new hospital with a central vacuum system and piped oxygen throughout. Wards were named alphabetically with K for Kennedy Ward being at the top of the hospital. 

In December 2008 Bevan Ward was opened. This ward named in honour of the founder of the NHS Aneurin Bevan consists of three clusters of eight ensuite patient rooms. Each cluster is slightly different in design allowing detailed research into patient satisfaction sleep quality privacy and infection rates. This has been heralded as the future of hospital care in the UK. Patients and staff alike are very pleased with the new facilities with some describing it as being like a five-star hotel. It was visited in 2009 by Health Secretary Alan Johnson who was apparently struck by the patient satisfaction.

The newly refurbished Fleming Ward opened in November 2009.

An eye clinic at the hospital received an award in 2010 from the Macular Disease Society for its work in Macular Degeneration.

The hospital trust became an independent NHS foundation trust on 1 April 2011.

'''USS ''Niagara''''' commonly called the '''US Brig ''Niagara''''' or the '''Flagship ''Niagara''''' is a wooden-hulled snow-brig that served as the relief flagship for Oliver Hazard Perry in the Battle of Lake Erie during the War of 1812. As the ship is certified for sail training by the United States Coast Guard it also designated '''SSV ''Niagara'''''. ''Niagara'' is one of the last remaining ships from the War of 1812 and is usually docked behind the Erie Maritime Museum in downtown Erie in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania as an outdoor exhibit for the museum. It also often travels the Great Lakes during the summer serving as an ambassador of Pennsylvania when not docked. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and was designated the official state ship of Pennsylvania by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1988.

''Niagara'' was constructed from 1812 to 1813 to protect the vulnerable American coastline on Lake Erie from the British and played a pivotal role in the battle for the lake. Along with most warships that served in the war ''Niagara'' was sunk for preservation on Presque Isle in 1820. Raised in 1913 it was rebuilt for the centennial of the Battle of Lake Erie. After deteriorating the restoration of ''Niagara'' was started again in the 1930s but was hampered by the lack of funds caused by the Great Depression and remained uncompleted until 1963. A more extensive restoration was carried out in 1988 in which much of the original ship was largely destroyed. The incorporation of new materials and modern equipment makes it ambiguous as to whether it is or is not a replica.

Graffiti of the Delije at Rajko Mitić Stadium.
Red Star’s fiercest and long standing city rival is FK Partizan the other large and popular sport society in Serbia. They also have many supporters in all other former Yugoslavian republics and also in the Yugoslavian diaspora. The rivalry started immediately after the creation of the two clubs in 1945. Red Star was founded with close ties to the Interior ministry and Partizan as the football section of the Yugoslav People's Army. Since then both clubs have been dominant in domestic football. The match is particularly noted for the passion of the Red Star's supporters called ''Delije'' and Partizan's supporters the ''Grobari'' (English: ""Gravediggers"" or ""Undertakers""). The stands of both teams feature fireworks coloured confetti flags rolls of paper torches smoke drums  giant posters and choreographies used to create visual grandeur and apply psychological pressure on the visiting teams hence the slogan ""Welcome to Hellgrade."" Some fans also sometimes use trumpets similar to the supporters in South America. This creates for the region a typical and distinctive Balkan Brass Band atmosphere. Both sets of supporters sing passionate songs against their rivals and the stadiums are known to bounce with the simultaneous jumping of the fans. There are many derbies in world football but very few compare to this it is more than just game and has a deeper meaning. The duel is regarded as one of the greatest football rivalries in the world and the matches between these rivals have been labeled as the '''Eternal derby'''. Given its widespread touch on the entirety of a major city it's dubbed one of along with the Old Firm the Rome derby and the Istanbul derby the most heated rivalries in European football. In 2009 British newspaper ''Daily Mail'' ranked the Eternal derby as fourth among the ten greatest football rivalries of all-time. The biggest attendance for a Red Star – Partizan match was about 108000 spectators at the Red Star Stadium.

729013,Argentina–England football rivalry,Early history,"
=== British influence on Argentine football ===


Alexander Watson Hutton ""the father of Argentine football"" founder of Alumni A.C. the best team of Argentina until its dissolution.
The goal scored by Ernesto Grillo during a 1953 friendly match (played at River Plate stadium) won by Argentina by 3-1.

In the latter half of the 19th century the Argentine capital Buenos Aires had a large expatriate British community of some 10000 people. As in many other parts of the world football was introduced to Argentina by the British. The first recorded football match played in Argentina was organized by the Buenos Aires Cricket Club in Palermo Buenos Aires on 20 June 1867 and played between two teams of British railway workers the White Caps and the Red Caps (it was common in the early days of football for teams to be distinguished by caps rather than jerseys).

The so-called ""father of Argentine football"" was a Glaswegian schoolteacher Alexander Watson Hutton who first taught football at the St. Andrew's Scots School in Buenos Aires in the early 1880s. On 4 February 1884 he founded the Buenos Aires English High School where he continued to instruct the pupils in the game. In 1898 Alumni Athletic Club a football team formed by the BAEHS students was established. Alumni would be the most successful team of Argentina winning a total of 22 titles until it was dissolved in 1913.

In 1891 Hutton established the Association Argentine Football League. Five clubs competed but only one season of games was played. A new league The Argentine Association Football League was formed 21 February 1893 and would eventually become the Argentine Football Association (AFA). In these early days of football in Argentina nearly all of the players and officials were expatriate Britons or of British extraction and the oldest football clubs in Argentina such as Rosario Central Newell's Old Boys and Quilmes A.C. were all founded by British expatriates. As the popularity of the game increased the British influence on the game waned and by 1912 the Association was renamed Asociación del Fútbol Argentino.

The British influence on the game in Argentina however shows in the continued use of terms such as ""corner"" and ""wing"" rather than their Spanish translations. The names of several famous teams in Argentina are also English in origin such as River Plate or influenced by the language such as Boca Juniors.

=== First matches ===
The national teams had met before their 1966 clash — Argentina were the first team other than Scotland to play England at Wembley Stadium in 1951 when the inaugural full international match between the sides ended with a 2–1 victory for England. They also played two matches in 1953 in Buenos Aires. The first a 3–1 victory for Argentina was considered an unofficial international by England who fielded a second-string team dubbed an FA XI. However this match appears in Argentina's list of official internationals and is listed as a full international by FIFA and so Argentines consider it to be their first ever victory over England. Afterwards one Argentine politician stated that ""we nationalised the railways and now we have nationalised football!"" 

The second 1953 international was an official match for both teams: England playing with a stronger line-up involving Alf Ramsey Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney; Argentina sticking with the same line-up used in the first match. The game however was abandoned after 36 minutes due to torrential rain with a 0–0 scoreline. The teams next met in the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile where England's 3–1 victory in the group stage led to Argentina's exit from the tournament. Argentina's first victory over England in a full international occurred in a 1–0 win in June 1964 during the Taça de Nações friendly tournament in Brazil.

Arne then returned with a new pointed beak and the pseudonym ''Alexander Barks'' was changed to ''Alexander X''.
After a while though Arne went to a novelty store to buy a fake beak which looked exactly like his old one. This new beak was drawn showing a small rubber band holding it in place until the threat of being sued was withdrawn. In the meanwhile however Disney's threat of a lawsuit which received very extensive publicity in Sweden had turned Arne Anka into a Swedish independence hero and increased his popularity manyfold.

734011,Preaching cross,Introduction,"
The Ruthwell Cross
A '''preaching cross''' is a Christian cross sometimes surmounting a pulpit which is erected outdoors to designate a preaching place.

In Britain and Ireland many free-standing upright crosses – or high crosses – were erected. Some of these crosses bear figurative or decorative carvings or inscriptions in runes. There are surviving free-standing crosses in Cornwall and Wales in the island of Iona and in the Hebrides as well as those in Ireland. Other stone crosses are found in Lancashire Cumbria and the Scottish Borders some of these in the Anglo-Saxon cross making tradition like the famous Ruthwell Cross. Whether these were especially associated with preaching is uncertain.  Later market crosses were generally not although all sorts of public announcements no doubt sometimes including preaching took place beside them.

The first Indoor World Cup was held in Leipzig Germany in 2003 where the home nation won both the men's and women's gold medals. Eurosport television ratings for the recent Indoor Hockey World Cup held in Leipzig Germany have shown the event to garner large audiences. A total of 20 million viewers watched 13 hours broadcast on Eurosport with ten matches aired live. Peak viewing audience reached 889000 viewers during the opening Poland vs.USA match with the average live viewing figure for the whole tournament at 601000. Germany and Poland Eurosport’s two strongest markets showed particular interest with more than 4 million different viewers tuning in from Germany and more than 1.5 million watching from Poland. The average audience calculated across several of Eurosport’s key territories showed a strong bias towards young males according to Eurosport’s research. Arnaud Simon Eurosport's Program Director commented: 'The first Indoor World Cup was a very exciting event well suited for television and with good production standards. These characteristics were rewarded with very strong ratings particularly considering that many of the matches were aired at off-peak viewing times.'

Els van Breda Vriesman the President of the International Hockey Federation added: 'The figures speak for themselves proving not only that hockey has mass appeal on television but also that the target audience presents a very attractive commercial proposition for potential sponsors and advertisers.'

Germany defended their titles in Vienna Austria in February 2007. The German men were successful although the women were beaten in the semi-final by Spain who went on to lose the final against the Netherlands.

179584,Seon of Balhae,Reign,"The territory of Balhae in 830 during the reign of king Seon of Balhae.
King Seon concentrated heavily on the empire's territorial expansion and led campaigns that resulted in the absorption of many northern Malgal tribes including Heishui Mohe. Southwest Little Goguryeo in Liaodong was absorbed into Balhae and also he ordered southward expansion towards Silla.

During his 12-year reign he dispatched embassies five times to Japan which was aimed at establishing diplomatic relations as well as increasing trade between the two kingdoms. Balhae emissaries were treated favorably even though Japan wanted Balhae to restrict the size of the embassies due to the costs associated with hosting them. The trade routes established across the Sea of Japan (East Sea) led to Balhae becoming one of Japan's most important trading partners.

He died in 830 and his grandson Dae Ijin succeeded to the throne.

654751,Varèse Sarabande,History,"Varèse Sarabande's roots trace back to 1972 with the introduction of a predecessor imprint called Varèse International.  The first LP release was ''Lumiere'' by Dub Taylor.  Varèse International Records was originally conceived as an ''avant garde'' classical label.  In the years that followed under the management of the founder–owners Dub Taylor and Chris Kuchler the label expanded its catalogue to include jazz classical and other genres of recordings.  In 1977 Tom Null's Sarabande Records merged with Varèse International to form Varèse Sarabande Records.  The early LP issues of the label were reissues of classical recordings from the American Decca Remington and JVC labels.  The first film soundtrack LP album was released in 1978.
    
Initially the new label was located at 6404 Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. During its early years it issued classical music and film score LPs and in the 1980s and 1990s became the world's largest producer of original motion picture scores on compact disc.  In 2003 Varèse celebrated its 25th anniversary by releasing two 4-CD compilation sets. Additional 4-CD sets were released in 2008 and 2013 to commemorate the label's 30th and 35th anniversaries.

Presently the label resides at 9100 Wilshire Blvd. Ste. 455E Beverly Hills and the soundtrack department is overseen by executive producer Robert Townson who has long been an impassioned advocate for the art of motion picture scoring.  To date he has produced over 1100 CD releases and is a staunch supporter of the latest generation of composers including Alexandre Desplat Brian Tyler Marco Beltrami John Powell and Michael Giacchino. Townson's 1000th album released in the summer of 2010 was a deluxe presentation of Alex North's Spartacus.

Varèse Sarabande releases oldies reissues through its Varèse Vintage imprint. The label is overseen by Cary E. Mansfield a veteran producer. Mansfield has been involved in all aspects of the music industry from sales to production for many major record labels including Universal Music and Motown Records for which he produced the critically acclaimed Hitsville USA box sets.  Varèse Vintage is dedicated to the preservation of multi-genre pop music from the 1950s 60s and 70s and has produced over 600 releases.

The label also handles exclusive distribution for other specialty labels: Fynsworth Alley Fuel 2000 Sunswept Music Perpetual Music 10 Spot Water Music Records Wildcat Records and Along the Blues Highway.  In 2013 Cutting Edge Group a British music services company and Wood Creek Capital purchased Varese Sarabande.

402254,Montague Druitt,Early life,"Druitt was born in Wimborne Minster Dorset England. He was the second son and third child of prominent local surgeon William Druitt and his wife Ann (''née'' Harvey). William Druitt was a justice of the peace a governor of the local grammar school and a regular worshipper at the local Anglican church the Minster. Six weeks after his birth Montague Druitt was christened at the Minster by his maternal great-uncle Reverend William Mayo. The Druitts lived at Westfield House which was the largest house in the town and set in its own grounds with stables and servants' cottages. Druitt had six brothers and sisters including an elder brother William who entered the law and a younger brother Edward who joined the Royal Engineers.
Winchester College ChapelPhotograph by Christophe Finot
Druitt was educated at Winchester College where he won a scholarship at the age of 13 and excelled at sports especially cricket and fives. He was active in the school's debating society an interest that might have spawned his desire to become a barrister. In debates he spoke in favour of French republicanism compulsory military service and the resignation of Benjamin Disraeli and against the Ottoman Empire the influence of Otto von Bismarck and the conduct of the government in the Tichborne case. He defended William Wordsworth as ""a bulwark of Protestantism"" and condemned the execution of King Charles I as ""a most dastardly murder that will always attach to England's fair name as a blot"". In a light-hearted debate he spoke against the proposition that bondage to fashion is a social evil.

In his final year at Winchester 1875–76 he was Prefect of Chapel treasurer of the debating society school fives champion and opening bowler for the cricket team. In June 1876 he played cricket for the school team against Eton College which won the match with a team including cricketing luminaries Ivo Bligh and Kynaston Studd as well as a future Principal Private Secretary at the Home Office Evelyn Ruggles-Brise. Druitt bowled out Studd for four. With a glowing academic record he was awarded a Winchester Scholarship to New College Oxford.

At New College he was popular with his peers and was elected Steward of the Junior Common Room by them. He played cricket and rugby for the college team and was the winner of both double and single fives at the university in 1877. In a seniors' cricket match in 1880 he bowled out William Patterson who later captained Kent County Cricket Club.

Druitt gained a second class in Classical Moderations in 1878 and graduated with a third class Bachelor of Arts degree in ''Literae Humaniores'' (Classics) in 1880. His youngest brother Arthur entered New College in 1882 just as Druitt was following in his eldest brother William's footsteps by embarking on a career in law.

253620,Schiller Institute,Cultural activity,"


===''Fidelio''===
The institute has published its quarterly magazine ''Fidelio'' since 1992 described as a ""Journal of Poetry Science and Statecraft."" It was co-founded and edited by Kenneth Kronberg. The magazine is named after Ludwig van Beethoven's opera ""Fidelio"" which tells the story of a political prisoner who is freed by the courage of his wife. At the time the magazine was founded Lyndon LaRouche was still in prison.

Its issues include articles on Homer Henry VII Benjamin Franklin Gottfried Leibniz the ''Vier ernste Gesänge'' of Johannes Brahms Vice President Dick Cheney Paul Kreingold’s “I.L. Peretz Father of the Yiddish Renaissance” and reviews of books art exhibits and musical and dramatic performances.

===Verdi tuning===

In 1988 the institute initiated a campaign to establish ""philosophical pitch"" or ""scientific pitch"" as the classical music concert pitch standard. This tuning system is based on middle C set at 256 Hz making concert A 430.539 Hz rather than the most commonly used 440 Hz. The Schiller Institute calls this system ""Verdi tuning"" because it was Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi who first sought to stop the increase in pitch to which orchestras are tuned. However Verdi used the French standard 435 Hz in writing his ''Requiem'' in 1874; later he indicated that 432 Hz was slightly more optimal. It is this A=432 Hz standard that the Schiller Institute advocates which does not align mathematically with their stated preference for C=256 Hz. French acoustic physicist Joseph Sauveur first researched then proposed the philosophical pitch standard in 1713 more than a century before Verdi began leading orchestras. Sauveur was strongly resisted by the musicians he was working with and the proposed standard was not adopted.

In 1999 the institute circulated a petition calling for the establishment of a permanent orchestra in Verdi's childhood home in Busseto Italy employing the special tuning in order to mark the composer's centennial.

The tuning initiative is opposed by Stefan Zucker. According to Zucker the Institute offered a bill in Italy to impose the Verdi tuning on state-sponsored musicians that included provisions for fines and confiscation of non-Verdi tuning forks. Zucker has written that he believes the claims about the Verdi tuning are historically inaccurate. Institute followers are reported by Tim Page of ''Newsday'' to have stood outside concert halls with petitions to ban the music of Vivaldi and even to have disrupted a concert conducted by Leonard Slatkin in order to pass out pamphlets titled ""Leonard Slatkin Serves Satan.""

===Other music initiatives===
In 1992 the institute published ''A Manual on the Rudiments of Tuning and Registration: Book I: Introduction and Human Singing Voice'' which discusses the tuning issue from the artistic and the scientific point of view. The Institute asserts the Bel Canto method of singing is ""one of the best examples of mankind's ability to discover an existing physical principle and to use that discovery to create new works of science and art which then increase humanity's power to build civilization."" They also assert that composers such as J.S. Bach Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Ludwig van Beethoven and Giuseppe Verdi all wrote with the distinct vocal registers of the Bel Canto system in mind and that their compositions intentionally exploit the different tone colors that these registers produce.

In 2010 25 LaRouche supporters protesting a new production of Richard Wagner's ''Der Ring des Nibelungen'' presented by the Los Angeles Opera carried signs that said ""Wagner: Loved by Nazis Rejected by Humans"" and ""L.A. County: $14 Million to promote Nazi Wagner Layoffs for Music Teachers"". They distributed flyers from the Schiller Institute which asked ""Does Los Angeles County have nothing better to do ... than bail out L.A. Opera so that it can celebrate the monstrous sexual fantasies and the cult of violence of that vile anti-Semite Wagner?""

The Schiller Institute presented a performance of Mozart's Requiem at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston on January 19 2014 the 50th anniversary of the performance of Mozart's Requiem and pontifical mass for John F. Kennedy which was held at the Cathedral. Remarks were made by Ambassador Ray Flynn and a letter was read from Irish President Michael D. Higgins. Recordings of speeches by President Kennedy were also featured.

===Drama and poetry===
The institute has published a four-volume series of English translations of the works of Friedrich Schiller entitled ''Poet of Freedom'' as well as some translations into other languages.

221968,Ralph Macchio,In popular culture,"DJ Q-Ball of the Bloodhound Gang released a song on his MySpace called ""The Ralph Macchio Memoirs"". Poetry slam artist Big Poppa E references Ralph Macchio in his performance poem ''The Wussy Boy Manifesto''. Nerdcore artist MC Frontalot mentions him in his song ""Braggadocio"". Macchio was featured in a brief cameo at the end of the No More Kings video for ""Sweep the Leg"".

Macchio's character in the ''Karate Kid'' film inspired the ""Daniel"" song by English singer Bat for Lashes; the front cover of the single shows Bat for Lashes with Daniel LaRusso's face painted on her back.

The song ""Ralph Macchio"" by Norwegian singer Annie is about her crush on Macchio in her youth over a 1980s-themed pop track.

In the TV series ''How I Met Your Mother'' Barney Stinson asserts that Macchio's character Daniel LaRusso in ''The Karate Kid'' isn't the real karate kid; instead it's Johnny Lawrence Daniel's nemesis in the film. In the 8th-season episode The Bro Mitzvah Macchio is invited to Barney's bachelor party although Barney is disappointed in the surprise expecting actor William Zabka the ""real Karate Kid"". For the duration of the episode the characters note the similarities between Barney and Macchio by which Barney is disgusted. At the end of the night the clown hired for the party's entertainment reveals himself to be Zabka.

In the ''Parks and Recreation'' episode ""The Master Plan"" Andy Dwyer unable to remember the proper name of Jean-Ralphio Saperstein declares ""That Ralph Macchio guy's a total douche"" after Jean-Ralphio flirts with April Ludgate.

450005,Solubility pump,Overview,"The solubility pump is driven by the coincidence of two processes in the ocean :

* The solubility of carbon dioxide is a strong inverse function of seawater temperature (i.e. solubility is greater in cooler water)
* The thermohaline circulation is driven by the formation of deep water at high latitudes where seawater is usually cooler and denser

Since deep water (that is seawater in the ocean's interior) is formed under the same surface conditions that promote carbon dioxide solubility it contains a higher concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon than might be expected from average surface concentrations.  Consequently these two processes act together to pump carbon from the atmosphere into the ocean's interior.

One consequence of this is that when deep water upwells in warmer equatorial latitudes it strongly outgasses carbon dioxide to the atmosphere because of the reduced solubility of the gas.

The solubility pump has a biological counterpart known as the biological pump.  For an overview of both pumps see Raven & Falkowski (1999).

494999,Anakinra,Basic chemical pharmacological data,"The anakinra molecule is a recombinant non-glycosylated version of human IL-1RA (RA for receptor antagonist) prepared from cultures of genetically modified ''Escherichia coli'' using recombinant DNA technology. It consists of 153 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 17257.6 g/mol (approx. 17.3 kilodaltons) and differs from native human IL-1RA in that it has the addition of a single methionine residue on its amino terminus.

Anakinra had an absolute bioavailability of 95% for healthy adults (n = 11) after a 70 mg subcutaneous bolus injection. Peak plasma concentrations of anakinra generally occurred 3 to 7 hours after s.c. administration of clinically relevant doses (1 to 2 mg/kg: n = 18) for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The terminal half-life ranged from 4 to 6 hours. After daily s.c. dosing for up to 24 weeks no unexpected accumulations of anakinra were observed in the plasma samples of rheumatoid arthritis patients.

555533,Ukrainian literature,"The ""minor renaissance"" Of Ukrainian literature in the 1940s","
Immediately after World War II in the second half of the 1940s Ukrainian literature outside of Soviet Ukraine experienced an unusually intensive period of development in the displaced persons' camps in western Germany and Austria. These camps which had become home to over 200000 Ukrainian war refugees including a significant number of writers and literary scholars represented a hub of fervent cultural activity so much so that the period 1945–1949 is often referred to by scholars as the ""minor renaissance"" of Ukrainian literature. Thrown together from various regions of Ukraine writers managed to replay on a small scale the activity of the 1920s. They convened congresses organized literary associations and published almanacs journals and books. A key role in the period's most important literary organization MUR was played by the linguist scholar and literary critic George Yurii Shevelov and the novelist Ulas Samchuk. Other most notable members of MUR included the dramatist prose writer essayist and publisher Ihor Kostetsky; the writer and scholar Viktor Petrov (V. Domontovych) the politically ambivalent Yurii Kosach and the poet Vasyl Barka. This ""minor renaissance"" of Ukrainian literature came to an end in the early 1950s as the majority of the authors emigrated to North America and continued their literary work there.

===The artistic Ukrainian movement===
The artistic Ukrainian movement (Mystetskyi ukrainskyi rukh). An artistic-literary organization of Ukrainian emigres in Europe. It was founded on 25 September 1945 in Furth Germany on the initiative of a committee consisting of Ivan Bahriany V. Domontovych (Viktor Petrov) Yurii Kosach Ihor Kostetsky Ivan Maistrenko and Yu. Sherekh (George Yurii Shevelov). MUR organized three writers' congresses (1945 1947 and 1948) as well as three conferences devoted to various aspects of literary activity. The head of the organization during its whole duration was Ulas Samchuk and its membership numbered 61. The objectives of MUR were to gather Ukrainian writers scattered by the Second World War to organize the publication of their works and to become a center for creative dialogues among members representing various styles and literary aims. MUR managed to organize almost all of the noted emigre writers and provide them with a forum for discussion while it stimulated an interest in literature among the public at large.

===George Yurii Shevelov===

George Yurii Shevelov (pseud: Yurii Sherekh) b 17 December 1908 in Kharkiv d 12 April 2002 in New York.

Having emigrated to Germany he taught at the Ukrainian Free University in Munich (1946–49) and obtained a doctorate there (1949). He was also vice-president of the MUR literary association (1945–49). After settling in the United States he served as lecturer in Russian and Ukrainian at Harvard University (1952–54) associate professor (1954–58) and professor of Slavic philology at Columbia University (1958–77) and president of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts and Sciences (1959–61 1981–6).

He was editor of the Rivne newspaper Volyn' (1941–43) and he fled to Germany in 1944 where he headed the literary-artistic organization MUR (1945–48). He emigrated to Canada after 1948 and became a longtime head of the Slovo Association of Ukrainian Writers in Exile. Samchuk's prose is deeply rooted in the 19th-century realist tradition. His novels are broad-canvas chronicles of the Ukrainian experience in the 20th century. Themes progress from the difficult national and cultural nascence in the trilogy Volyn' (Volhynia 1932 1935 1937) the devastating Ukrainian Famine-Genocide of 1932–33 in Mariia (1934) and the Second World War and forced Ukrainian labor in the trilogy Ost (East 1948 1957 1982).

Kostetsky published prolifically during the late 1940s. His prose works combined traditional and modernist (expressionist surrealist dadaist) forms of expression. His experimental plays written in the 1940s anticipated many stylistic devices subsequently mastered by such dramatists as Samuel Beckett.

===Viktor Petrov===

His dramatic works include Obloha (The Siege 1943)--a dramatic poem—and the tragedy Diistvo pro Iuriia Peremozhtsia (Play about Yurii the Conqueror 1947). By far the largest and most interesting body of work is Kosach's prose written prior to his emigration to the United States.

===Vasyl Barka===

He was a poet writer literary critic and translator. An emigre from 1943 he lived in Germany where he was active in the MUR literary association before settling in the United States in 1949. Barka's orphic works require intuitive rather than logical comprehension. His poetry developed and grew in stature from the early lyrical collections to the monumental 4000-strophe epic novel in verse ""Svidok Dlia Sontsia Shestykrylykh"" (The Witness for the Sun of Seraphims 1981) addressed to the theme of reconciliation between 'man and the Creator.' His first novel Rai (Paradise 1953) deals with the Soviet 'paradise.' His second novel Zhovtyi kniaz' (The Yellow Prince 1962 1968) about the Ukrainian Famine-Genocide of 1932–33 was translated into French (Paris 1981) and served as the basis for Oles Yanchuk's 1993 Ukrainian feature film Holod-33 (Famine-33).

300693,Stepanakert,History,"===Founding and Soviet era===
Stepanakert countryside
According to medieval Armenian sources the settlement was first mentioned as Vararakn (Վարարակն meaning ""rapid spring"" in Armenian) a name that remained in use until 1847 when it was renamed Khankendi. Azerbaijani sources generally say that the  settlement was founded in the late eighteenth century as a private residence for khans of the Karabakh Khanate and was thus called Khankendi (Turkic for ""the khan's village""). The settlement was initially called Khanin Kendi (Xanın kəndi) but then was shortened to Khankendi. After the Russian Empire gained the territory of the Karabakh Khanate through the Russo-Persian War of 1804-1813 the name Khankendi was charted on Russian maps.

In 1923 Khankendi was renamed Stepanakert by the Soviet government to honor Stepan Shahumyan ethnic Armenian leader of the 26 Baku Commissars and after the Shusha pogrom had resulted in major destruction at Shusha the former regional capital Stepanakert was made the capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO). In time Stepanakert grew to become the region's most important city (a status it received in 1940). Its population rose from 10459 in 1939 to 33000 in 1978.

In 1926 municipal authorities adopted a new city layout designed by the prominent Armenian architect Alexander Tamanian; two additional designs for expansion were approved later on in the 1930s and 1960s both of which retained Tamanian's initial plan. Several schools and two ""polyclinics"" were established and an Armenian drama theater was founded in 1932 and named after Maxim Gorky. Stepanakert served as Nagorno-Karabakh's main economic hub and by the mid-1980s there were nineteen production facilities in the city.

===Nagorno-Karabakh War and independence===
Freedom Fighters' (Azatamartikneri) boulevard at the centre of Stepanakert
The political and economic reforms that General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev had initiated in 1985 saw a marked decentralization of Soviet authority. Armenians in both Armenia proper and Nagorno-Karabakh viewed Gorbachev's reform program as an opportunity to unite the two together. On February 20 1988 tens of thousands of Armenians gathered to demonstrate in Stepanakert's Lenin (now Renaissance) Square to demand that the region be joined to Armenia. On the same day the Supreme Soviet of Nagorno-Karabakh voted to join the Armenian SSR a move staunchly opposed by the Soviet Azerbaijani authorities. Relations between Stepankert's Armenians and Azerbaijanis who supported the Azerbaijani government's position deteriorated in the following years and as a result nearly all of the Azerbaijanis fled the city.

After Azerbaijan declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 Stepanakert was renamed by the Azerbaijani government back to Khankendi as part of a campaign against communism and Azerification. Fighting broke out over control of Nagorno-Karabakh which eventually resulted in Armenian control of the region and a connecting corridor to Armenia to the west. Prior to the conflict Stepanakert was the largest city of the NKAO with a population of 70000 out of a total 189000 (Armenians at the time comprised 75% of the region's total population). By early 1992 that figure had dropped to 50000.

Downtown Stepanakert
During the war the city suffered immense damage from Azeri bombardment especially in early 1992 when the Azerbaijanis used the town of Shushi as an artillery firebase to rain down GRAD missiles upon it. So destructive was the damage caused by the incessant bombardment that a journalist for ''Time'' noted in an April 1992 article that ""scarcely a single building had escaped damage in Stepanakert."" The Azerbaijani military staged several ground attacks against the city which were successfully repulsed by Armenian forces. It was not until May 9 1992 with the capture of Shusha that the ground bombardment ceased. The city nevertheless continued to suffer aerial bombardment for the remainder of the war.

There has been an unofficial cease-fire observed since 1994.

346554,Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge,History,"Opened on April 8 1994 it was the first bridge across the lower Mekong and the second on the full course of the Mekong. 

The cost was about £19 million funded by the Australian government as development aid for Laos.

The bridge was designed and built by Australian companies as a demonstration of their ability to complete major infrastructural projects in Southeast Asia. The concept design of a balanced cantilever bridge was proposed by Bruce Ramsay of VSL with the final design carried out by Maunsell consulting engineers.

The official name of the bridge was changed by the addition of ""First"" after the Second Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge further south at Savannakhet opened in January 2007.

91395,Parents Music Resource Center,Parental Advisory sticker,"


On November 1 1985 before the hearing ended the RIAA agreed to put ""Parental Advisory"" labels on selected releases at their own discretion. The labels were generic unlike the original idea of a descriptive label categorizing the explicit lyrics.

Many record stores refused to sell albums containing the label (most notably Wal-Mart) and others limited sales of those albums to adults.  One of the albums to receive the ""Parental Advisory"" sticker was Frank Zappa's Grammy-winning album ''Jazz from Hell'' presumably for the use of the word ""Hell"" in its title but also for the song ""G-Spot Tornado"" even though it is a collection of instrumental pieces and contains no lyrics at all.

It is uncertain whether the ""Tipper sticker"" is effective in preventing children from being exposed to explicit content. Some citing the ""forbidden-fruit effect"" suggest that the sticker actually '''''increases''''' record sales. Examples of this claim include:
*Philip Bailey of Earth Wind & Fire stated: ""For the most part the sticker might even sell more records in some areas - all you've got to do is tell somebody this is a no-no and then that's what they want to go see.""
*Ice-T's ""Freedom of Speech"" states: ""Hey PMRC you stupid fuckin' assholes/The sticker on the record is what makes 'em sell gold./Can't you see you alcoholic idiots/The more you try to suppress us the larger we get.""
*The Furnaceface song ""We Love You Tipper Gore"" from their 1991 album ''Just Buy It'' suggests that the label ""only whets my appetite ... only makes us want to hear it that much more.""

5629,Guitar,Introduction,"



The '''guitar''' is a musical instrument classified as a fretted string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings usually having six.  The sound is projected either acoustically using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar) or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for  an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers thumb or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern the vihuela the four-course Renaissance guitar and the five-course baroque guitar all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.

There are three main types of modern acoustic guitar: the classical guitar (nylon-string guitar) the steel-string acoustic guitar and the archtop guitar which is sometimes called a ""jazz guitar"". The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration amplified by the hollow body of the guitar which acts as a resonating chamber. The classical guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive finger-picking technique where each string is plucked individually by the player's fingers as opposed to being strummed. The term ""finger-picking"" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk blues bluegrass and country guitar playing in the United States. The acoustic bass guitar is a low-pitched instrument that is one octave below a regular guitar.

Electric guitars introduced in the 1930s use an amplifier and a loudspeaker that both makes the sound of the instrument loud enough for the performers and audience to hear and given that it produces an electric signal when played that can electronically manipulate and shape the tone using an equalizer (e.g. bass and treble tone controls) and a huge variety of electronic effects units the most commonly used ones being distortion (or ""overdrive"") and reverb. Early amplified guitars employed a hollow body but a solid wood body was eventually found more suitable during the 1960s and 1970s as it was less prone to unwanted acoustic feedback ""howls"". As with acoustic guitars there are a number of types of electric guitars including hollowbody guitars archtop guitars (used in jazz guitar blues and rockabilly) and solid-body guitars which are widely used in rock music.

The loud amplified sound and sonic power of the electric guitar played through a guitar amp has played a key role in the development of blues and rock music both as an accompaniment instrument (playing riffs and chords) and performing guitar solos and in many rock subgenres notably heavy metal music and punk rock. The electric guitar has had a major influence on popular culture. The guitar is used in a wide variety of musical genres worldwide. It is recognized as a primary instrument in genres such as blues bluegrass country flamenco folk jazz jota mariachi metal punk reggae rock soul and many forms of pop.

"
170816,Thoros II Prince of Armenia,His rule,"
=== The liberation of Armenian Cilicia ===
Thoros escaped from Constantinople about the year 1143; he fled to the island of Cyprus which was then under Byzantine suzerainty aboard a Venetian vessel and then found his way to Antioch. He took refuge at the Court of his cousin Count Joscelin II of Edessa. From there in the company of a few trusted comrades he was assisted by a Syrian priest who led them by night to a safe shelter by the river Pyramus (now ''Ceyhan River'' in Turkey).

They then crossed the Amanus range (now ''Nur Mountains'' in Turkey) and reached the mountainous Armenian strongholds in the Taurus Mountains where Thoros began gathering a new following. He recaptured the family stronghold of Vahka and two of his brothers Stephen and Mleh joined him. He made friends with a neighboring Frankish lord Simon of Raban whose daughter he married.



=== The first Byzantine attack against Cilicia ===
In 1151 while the Byzantines were distracted by the Moslem attack on Turbessel Thoros swept down into the Cilician plain and defeated and slew the Byzantine governor Thomas at the gates of Mamistra. Emperor Manuel I at once sent his cousin Andronicus Comnenus with an army to recover the territory lost to Thoros. But Thoros was well prepared for the unsuspecting Greeks and consequently won a decisive victory: as Andronicus Comnenus moved up to besiege Thoros at Mamistra the Armenians made a sudden sortie and caught him unawares. His army was routed and he fled back in disgrace to Constantinople.

In the meantime the Hethumids who were pro-Byzantine sympathizers did not overlook any opportunity for engaging in an anti-Roupenian armed conflict. Andronicus Comnenus’s mission was such an opportunity but it was not an occasion for glory: many of their numbers were killed by Thoros’s aggressive strategy and many more were taken into captivity. Among the captives were the two illustrious members Oshin II of Lampron and his son Hethum. Oshin II was eventually released for a ransom but his son was kept as hostage; but Thoros arranged the marriage of his daughter to Hethum and returned half the ransom money to the groom’s father Oshin II of Lampron.



=== Wars with the Seldjuks and Antioch ===
Emperor Manuel I Comnenus persuaded the Seljuk Sultan of Iconium Masud I to attack Thoros and demand his submission to the Sultan’s suzerainty. However the ensuing Seljuk attack which in fact was provoked by an Armenian raid into Seljuk lands in Cappadocia in the winter of 1154 was routed successfully by Thoros in collaboration with a contingent of the Knights Templar.



Then the emperor turned to Antioch for help; he offered to recognize the new Prince Raynald of Châtillon if the Franks of Antioch would fight for him against Thoros; he also promised a money-subsidy if the work were properly done. Raynald willingly complied as the Armenians had advanced into the district of Alexandretta (now ''İskenderun'' in Turkey) which the Franks claimed as part of the Principality of Antioch.

After a short battle near Alexendretta Raynald drove the Armenian back into Cilicia; and he presented the re-conquered country to the Knights Templar. Other view is that after the battle Raynald was forced to return home covered with humiliation; and later on Thoros voluntarily surrendered to the brethren the fortresses in question and the Knights in turn took oath ''“to assist the Armenians on all occasions where they needed help.”'' In 1156 the Jacobites were allowed to build a new cathedral in Antioch at whose dedication the Princess Constance and Thoros assisted.

Having secured the land that he wanted Raynald demanded his subsidies from the Emperor who refused them pointing out that the main task had yet to be done. Raynald quickly sided with Thoros and conspired to attack Cyprus; and the Armenians attacked the few remaining Byzantine fortresses in Cilicia.

=== The sack of Cyprus ===
In the spring of 1156 Raynald of Châtillon and Thoros made a sudden landing on Cyprus. Thoros and Prince Raynald both conducted widespread plundering of the island: the Franks and Armenians marched up and down the island robbing and pillaging every building that they saw churches and convents as well as shops and private houses. The corps were burnt; the herds were rounded up together with all the population and driven down to the coast.

The nightmare lasted about three weeks; then on the rumor of an imperial fleet in the offing Raynald gave the order for re-embarkation. The ships were loaded up with booty; and every Cypriot was forced to ransom himself.

In the meantime Thoros quickly established a friendly rapport with Kilij Arslan II the new Seljuk sultan of Iconium; and in 1158 a peace treaty was concluded.



=== The second Byzantine attack against Cilicia ===
In the summer of 1158 Manuel I Comnenus launched his second assault on Thoros; at the head of an army he marched down the usual routes leading to Seleucia. There with a small rapid deployment force of horsemen and Seleucian troops he launched a surprise attack on Thoros. Thoros was at Tarsus suspecting nothing when suddenly one day in late October a Latin pilgrim whom he had entertained came rushing back to his Court to tell him that he had seen Imperial troops only a day’s march away. Thoros collected his family his intimate friends and his treasure and fled at once to the mountains.

Next day the Emperor Manuel entered the Cilician plain; within a fortnight all the Cilician cities as far as Anazarbus were in his power. But Thoros himself still eluded him: while Byzantine detachments scoured the valleys he fled from hill-top to hill-top and at last found refuge on a crag called ''Dadjog'' near the sources of the river Cydnus; only his two most trusted servants knew where he lay hidden. Thus much of Cilicia was restored back to Byzantine control but Thoros still held the mountainous regions in the north. 

Eventually King Baldwin III of Jerusalem intervened and successfully brokered a peace treaty between the Emperor and Thoros: Thoros had to walk barefoot and bareheaded to the camp of the emperor; there he prostrated himself in the dust before the imperial platform. Then pardon was accorded to him for his transgressions both in Cilicia and Cyprus and still allowed to hold partial possession in Cilicia.

=== The murder of his brother ===

Thoros’s brother Stephen ignoring Thoros’s official pledges to Manuel with the help of a few of his supporters continued attacking Greek garrisons thus giving Andronicus Euphorbenus the Byzantine governor stationed in Tarsus the opportunity to sabotage the treaty. Stephen was invited to a banquet held in the governor’s residence where he was seized upon arrival and his mutilated corpse was flung over the gates of Tarsus.

Thoros who had his own reasons for desiring Stephen’s murder accused of Andronicus Euphorbenus of complicity and swept down on Mamistra Anazarbus and Vahka surprising and murdering the Greek garrisons. Eventually reconciliation with the emperor was negotiated through the mediation of King Amalric I of Jerusalem: Andronicus Euphorbenus was recalled and replaced by Konstantinos Kalamanos as the new Byzantine governor in Tarsus.

=== In alliance with the crusaders ===

In 1164 when Nur ed-Din the emir of Aleppo knew that King Amalric I had left for Egypt he struck at the Principality of Antioch and laid siege to the key-fortress of Harenc. Prince Bohemond III of Antioch called upon Count Raymond III of Tripoli Thoros and Konstantinos Kalamanos to come to his rescue. At the news of their coming Nur ed-Din raised the siege; as he retired Bohemond decided to follow in pursuit. The armies made contact on 10 August near Artah. Ignoring a warning from Thoros Bohemond attacked at once and when the Moslems feigned flight rushed headlong after them only to fall into an ambush. Thoros and his brother Mleh who had been more cautious escaped from the battlefield.

Around that time (in 1164 or in 1167) Thoros visited Jerusalem and suggested the colonization of a large number of Armenians; but the Latin prelates forced King Amalric I to refuse the offer by their insistence that they should pay the ''dime'' (a special tax).

===The third Byzantine attack against Cilicia===
Intermittent fighting erupted everywhere harassing the Greek forces throughout Cilicia. In 1168 Emperor Manuel I obsessed with his dilemma with Thoros marched his armies into Cilicia for the third time under the command of Konstantinos Kalamanos. But Konstantinos Kalamanos was able to produce only limited successes which in the end induced Byzantium to renounce its right of possession of the whole of Cilicia so long as it had access to the ports of the Gulf of Alexandretta. Byzantium also disclaimed all rights to direct government of Cilicia and accepted in settlement only Thoros’s recognition of Byzantine suzerainty.

584134,Kittatinny Mountain,Kittatinny and Flatbrook Valleys,"
To the east of the Kittatinny Mountain is the Great Kittatinny Valley. This is drained by the Paulinskill river in the south and the Wallkill River in the north. The Big Flatbrook drains the mountain on the northwestern end beginning at Steam mill swamp and flows in a southwesterly direction which drains into the Delaware River near Flatbrookville.  This area is known as the Flatbrook Valley. 
The Port Jervis trough is at the northwestern end of the mountain.
The Delaware River flows near the mountain at the south end finally cutting across the ridge at the Delaware Water Gap just south of Mount Tammany.

The Kittatinnies are a far northeastern extension of the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian Mountains.  In Pennsylvania the ridge forming the Kittatinnies becomes known as Blue Mountain and runs southwest for  nearly to Maryland. In Franklin County Pennsylvania however a parallel ridge to Blue Mountain is named ""Kittatinny Mountain""; the Pennsylvania Turnpike tunnels through both ridges (a very short distance apart) with the western tunnel named ""Kittatinny Mountain"" and the eastern one ""Blue Mountain."" To the north in New York the ridge is known as the Shawangunk Mountains which goes to Kingston New York.

580596,Sin Moo Hapkido,Uniform,"There are many variations when it comes to uniforms in Sin Moo Hapkido as there was no official uniform for many years.  Although a diamond pattern on the dobok top is a Hapkido designation.  Most European schools used white uniforms with black trim and most American schools used plain white judo uniforms for the first 15 years or so.

The current official uniform is a grey colored dobok often with ties at the bottoms (for leg weights) though many people chose to leave the legs open.  There is a World Sin Moo Hapkido logo on the left lapel and an oval shaped Sin Moo Hapkido logo on the back.

The official uniform (dobok) for ""Masters"" rank and above 6th Dan and higher is white with gold trim as seen in Bruce Lee's ""Game of Death"" movie.

568566,North Luzon Expressway,Tolls,"Bocaue Toll Plaza in Bulacan.

The tollway has two sections: an open section and a closed section. The open section (within Metro Manila) charges a flat toll based on vehicle class and is employed to reduce the number of toll barriers (and associated bottlenecks) within the metropolis. The closed section is distance-based charging based on the class of vehicle and distance traveled. When the expressway was modernized an electronic toll collection system was set up for Class 1 vehicles while prepaid magnetic cards were assigned to Class 2 and 3 vehicles to speed up transactions at toll booths. These have since been replaced by a unified ETC system operated by  Easytrip Services Corporation. As of October 1 2011 all tolls (as shown below) include the 12% Value-Added Tax (VAT).

613063,Mitch Skandalakis,1998 campaign for Lieutenant Governor,"In 1998 he hired former Christian Coalition executive director Ralph Reed as his campaign manager and ran for Lieutenant Governor of Georgia as a right wing conservative. While earlier he had ""good relations with Atlanta's gay and lesbian community"" he needed stronger Christian credentials to win the primary; hiring Reed was thought to provide those credentials. Skandalakis placed first among five candidates in the Republican primary then defeated conservative State Senator Clint Day in a bitterly contested primary run-off. Skandalakis's campaign drew criticism for running ""advertisements portraying one rival in racial stereotypes and another as a drug addict"". The spots from the campaign were cited years later as examples of the ""dirty tactics"" of Ralph Reed:In the autumn of 1998 Georgians were jolted from their armchairs by television ads run by a Republican candidate for lieutenant governor with the nicely onomatopoeic name of Mitch Skandalakis. One commercial played what political writer Josh Marshall later described as ""the DW Griffith card"" charging gross incompetence on the part of Atlanta's predominantly black political leadership. Another featured an actor who resembled Skandalakis's opponent state senator Mark Taylor shuffling down a hallway at a well-known psychiatric and drug treatment facility near Atlanta. The ads were arresting but they backfired. Skandalakis got stomped by Taylor while a surprisingly high turnout among African Americans helped produce a victory for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Roy Barnes and other Democrats running statewide.

Although successful with Reed's help in winning the Republican primary Skandalakis's strategy of negative campaigning backfired in the general election. The ad that suggested that his opponent Democratic candidate and State Senator Mark Taylor had ongoing drug problems and was being treated in a rehabilitation center solicited a legal response from Taylor—a $1 million lawsuit for libel. In the end Skandalakis lost in a landslide in part because he had alienated the Atlanta vote and had made a habit out of insulting Atlanta's (African American) mayor Bill Campbell and other African American officials ""a classic example of racebaiting."" These attacks ""also offended many whites who perceived them to be race baiting."" He agreed to pay $50000 to a charity to settle the lawsuit: ""in hindsight Skandalakis said he regrets airing the ad."" Later Skandalakis's negative advertising was blamed for Republican losses and he was viewed as ""a drag on the Republican ticket.""

741964,Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance,Ministry of Pensions,"The Ministry of Pensions was created in 1916 to handle the payment of war pensions to former members of the Armed Forces and their dependants. It was expanded rapidly during the opening months of the Second World War by secondment of civil servants from the Inland Revenue and other government departments. In 1940 most of the Ministry was moved to Cleveleys and its close environs in Lancashire. The Rossall School was taken over initially but later several hundred employees worked in prefabricated one-storey office buildings assembled on a site that had been part of the Holt's farm in the Norcross section of Carleton. Sir Walter Womersley was the Minister during the war. Other ministers are listed under Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. The Ministry moved to buildings on Millbank in London in 1949.

154488,Virtual file system,Introduction,"


A '''virtual file system''' ('''VFS''') or '''virtual filesystem switch''' is an abstraction layer on top of a more concrete file system. The purpose of a VFS is to allow client applications to access different types of concrete file systems in a uniform way. A VFS can for example be used to access local and network storage devices transparently without the client application noticing the difference. It can be used to bridge the differences in Windows classic Mac OS/macOS and Unix filesystems so that applications can access files on local file systems of those types without having to know what type of file system they are accessing.

A VFS specifies an interface (or a ""contract"") between the kernel and a concrete file system. Therefore it is easy to add support for new file system types to the kernel simply by fulfilling the contract.  The terms of the contract might change incompatibly from release to release which would require that concrete file system support be recompiled and possibly modified before recompilation to allow it to work with a new release of the operating system; or the supplier of the operating system might make only backward-compatible changes to the contract so that concrete file system support built for a given release of the operating system would work with future versions of the operating system.

89925,Ranulf Flambard,Work under Rufus,"A drawing of the interior of Westminster hall dating from about 1808. The walls date to Ranulf's construction work at the site.
Before the death of William the Conqueror Ranulf held a prebend in the diocese of Salisbury. Early in the reign of Rufus he held the offices of dean of Christchurch in Twynham Hampshire and was a prebendary of London and Lincoln. He was still keeper of the king's seal and also may have been in charge of the royal ''scriptorium''. He is usually described as the chaplain of Rufus but he is also called treasurer and sometimes ''capitalis justicaiarius''. Other times his role is given the title ''procurator''. William of Malmesbury calls him the ""manager of the whole kingdom"".

At Christchurch he reduced the number of canons serving the church from 25 to 13 through not replacing clerks who died. Ranulf kept the revenues that would have gone to the missing canons and used it to rebuild the church. Some medieval sources claim that in rebuilding the church at Twynham he not only demolished the church he was replacing but nine others that were nearby.

As chief financial administrator he bore the brunt of the chronicler's condemnations for extortion and efforts to increase royal revenues. Besides attempts to increase the efficiency of collection and the rate of taxation Ranulf created new methods of raising money. One of his new measures in revenue collection came in 1094 when the fyrd or English militia was assembled to fight in Normandy against the king's brother Robert Curthose. When all the men had assembled instead of sending them to Normandy Ranulf dismissed them after collecting the 10 shillings that each man had been given by their district for maintenance. Ranulf then spent the money on mercenaries. Ranulf also actively pressed lawsuits including bringing suit against Anselm on the day of Anselm's consecration as Archbishop of Canterbury. Another innovation was the attempt to collect a relief much like the relief due from vassals at the death of an overlord from the under-tenants of church lands when the church office changed hands. This attempt came at the death of Wulfstan Bishop of Worcester in 1095 when the king sent writs to the free tenants of the bishop setting the amount of relief owed to the king. This attempt was not repeated however.

He administered for the king a large proportion of the vacant ecclesiastical offices. He personally managed sixteen abbeys or bishoprics. Eventually he obtained the wealthy see of Durham for himself in May 1099 being consecrated on 5 June 1099. He had been the custodian of the see since the death of the previous bishop in early 1096. At his consecration he managed to avoid giving a profession of obedience to Thomas the Archbishop of York just as his predecessor had done. William of Malmesbury a medieval chronicler accused Ranulf of paying 1000 pounds for the bishopric. He was given ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Carlisle and Cumbria because his predecessors had done so as bishops of Lindisfarne but he only exercised this for a short time as after the accession of Henry I jurisdiction over these areas was transferred to the diocese of York.

It has been suggested that Ranulf may have been the first Justiciar of all England (or chief justiciar) although he never held the title and it is not clear if his power was as extensive as Roger of Salisbury in the following reign. He ran the government of England while Rufus was fighting in Normandy not only raising money but issuing writs and judging court cases. William of Malmesbury in describing Ranulf's financial efforts said that he ""skinned the rich ground the down the poor and swept other men's inheritances into his net."" Another medieval chronicler Orderic Vitalis said that Ranulf planned to revise the survey of England almost certainly Domesday Book and that he planned to use that revised survey to confiscate all excess holdings over a certain amount. If this was really planned it was never carried out.

Ranulf often worked in concert with Haimo the ''dapifer'' or seneschal and Urse d'Abetot in carrying out royal judgements. On one occasion they along with Robert Bloet the Bishop of Lincoln reassessed the lands of Thorney Abbey for taxes. On another occasion they were ordered along with Ralph de Luffa Bishop of Chichester to see that the abbey of Fecamp received custody of a church at Steyning. Others who often worked with Ranulf were Robert FitzHaimo Roger Bigod and Eudo the ''dapifer''. These men are sometimes considered by historians to be the first Barons of the Exchequer. There are also signs during Ranulf's administration of resident justices in the counties who held courts for the king. Itinerant justices were probably also used to hear pleas that were reserved to the crown.

While administering England for Rufus Ranulf also supervised construction projects. Under his management the first stone bridge in London was constructed. Ranulf also built a wall around the White Tower in London enclosing the inner ward. A new hall at Westminster was also built of which the outside walls of Westminster Hall are still surviving. He started building the church at Christchurch at Twynham which he had been granted by Rufus. After Rufus' death the church was confiscated from Ranulf and building work ceased. The crypts and transepts of the current church however date from Ranulf's construction work.

130945,World Summit on the Information Society,Civil society,"
A number of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) scientific institutions community media and others  participated as ""civil society"" in the preparations for the summit as well as the High Level Event itself drawing attention to human rights people-centered development freedom of speech and press freedom.

Youth and civil society representatives played key roles in the whole WSIS process. Young leaders from different countries notably Nick and Alex Fielding from Canada Tarek from Tunisia and Mr. Zeeshan Shoki from Pakistan were the active and founding members of the Global WSIS Youth Caucus having founded youth caucuses in their home countries: Canada WSIS Youth Caucus Tunisia WSIS Youth Caucus and Pakistan WSIS Youth Caucus. Young leaders participated in both the Geneva and Tunis phases. Youth Day was celebrated and youth showcased their projects and organised events at the summit. Youth also participated in the preparation of the WSIS Declaration and Plan of Action.

There was lots of WSIS-related discussion outside the official conferences. Workshops on the themes of the summit were held e.g. at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre and plans are shaping up for alternative events outside and parallel to the official WSIS summit.

In Germany a WSIS working group initiated by the Network New Media and the Heinrich Böll Foundation has been meeting continuously since mid-2002. This group has gradually developed into a broader Germany-wide civil society coordination for the WSIS.

One of the most significant results of civil society participation in the WSIS first phase was the insertion in the final declaration signed by the nation's delegates of the clear distinction between three societal model of digitally-driven increasement of awareness : proprietary open-source and free software based models. It is the result of the work led by Francis Muguet as co-chair of Patent Copyrights and Trademark working group.

Some civil society groups expressed alarm that the 2005 phase of the WSIS was being held in Tunisia a country with serious human rights violations. A fact-finding mission to Tunisia in January 2005 by the Tunisia Monitoring Group (TMG) a coalition of 14 members of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange found serious cause for concern about the current state of freedom of expression and of civil liberties in the country including gross restrictions on freedom of the press media publishing and the Internet.

The coalition published a 60-page report that recommends steps the Tunisian government needs to take to bring the country in line with international human rights standards. At the third WSIS Preparatory Committee meeting in Geneva in September 2005 the TMG launched an update to the report that found no improvements in the human rights situation.

The Digital solidarity fund an independent body aiming to reduce the digital divide was established following discussions which took place during the Tunis summit in 2005.

241604,Dungeness Nuclear Power Station,Consideration of Dungeness C,"On 15 April 2009 Dungeness was included in a list of 11 potential sites for new nuclear power stations at the request of EDF Energy which owns and operates Dungeness B. The government did not include Dungeness C in its draft National Policy Statement published on 9 November 2009 citing environmental reasons and concerns about coastal erosion and associated flood risk. The site was ruled out by Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Chris Huhne in October 2010 with the former government's list of eleven potential sites reduced to eight. Despite these environmental concerns local Conservative MP Damien Collins supported by some local residents has lobbied Parliament to reconsider this position.

442042,Coffee bean,Composition,"Coffee cherry cross-section

The term ""green coffee bean"" refers to unroasted mature or immature coffee beans. These have been processed by wet or dry methods for removing the outer pulp and mucilage and have an intact wax layer on the outer surface. When immature they are green. When mature they have a brown to yellow or reddish color and typically weigh 300 to 330 mg per dried coffee bean. Nonvolatile and volatile compounds in green coffee beans such as caffeine deter many insects and animals from eating them. Further both nonvolatile and volatile compounds contribute to the flavor of the coffee bean when it is roasted. Nonvolatile nitrogenous compounds (including alkaloids trigonelline proteins and free amino acids) and carbohydrates are of major importance in producing the full aroma of roasted coffee and for its biological action. Since the mid 2000s green coffee extract has been sold as a nutritional supplement and has been clinically studied for its chlorogenic acid content and for its lipolytic and weight-loss properties.

===Nonvolatile alkaloids===
Immature ''Coffea canephora'' berries on a tree in Goa India
Caffeine (''137-trimethyl-xanthine'') is the alkaloid most present in green and roasted coffee beans. The content of caffeine is between 1.0% and 2.5% by weight of dry green coffee beans. The content of caffeine does not change during maturation of green coffee beans. Lower concentrations of theophylline theobromine paraxanthine liberine and methylliberine can be found. The concentration of theophylline an alkaloid noted for its presence in green tea is reduced during the roasting process usually about 15 minutes at  whereas the concentrations of most other alkaloids are not changed. The solubility of caffeine in water increases with temperature and with the addition of chlorogenic acids citric acid or tartaric acid all of which are present in green coffee beans.  For example  of caffeine dissolves in  of water at room temperature and  at . The xanthine alkaloids are odorless but have a bitter taste in water which is masked by organic acids present in green coffee however.

Trigonelline (''N''-methyl-nicotinate) is a derivative of vitamin B6 that is not as bitter as caffeine. In green coffee beans the content is between 0.6% and 1.0%. At a roasting temperature of  85% of the trigonelline is degraded to nicotinic acid leaving small amounts of the unchanged molecule in the roasted beans. In green coffee beans trigonelline is synthesized from nicotinic acid (pyridinium-3-carboxylic acid) by methylation from methionine a sulfur-containing amino acid. Mutagenic activity of trigonelline has been reported.

===Proteins and amino acids===
Proteins account for 8% to 12% of dried green coffee beans. A majority of the proteins are of the 11-S storage kind (alpha – component of 32 kDa beta – component of 22 kDa) most of which are degraded to free amino acids during maturation of green coffee beans. Further 11-S storage proteins are degraded to their individual amino acids under roasting temperature thus are an additional source of bitter components due to generation of Maillard reaction products. High temperature and oxygen concentration and low pH degrade 11-S storage proteins of green coffee beans to low-molecular-weight peptides and amino acids. The degradation is accelerated in the presence of organic acids such as chlorogenic acids and their derivatives. Other proteins include enzymes such as catalase and polyphenol oxidase which are important for the maturation of green coffee beans. Mature coffee contains free amino acids (4.0 mg amino acid/g robusta coffee and up to 4.5 mg amino acid/g arabica coffee). In ''Coffea arabica'' alanine is the amino acid with the highest concentration i.e. 1.2 mg/g followed by asparagine of 0.66 mg/g whereas in ''C. robusta'' alanine is present at a concentration of 0.8 mg/g and asparagine at 0.36 mg/g. The free hydrophobic amino acids in fresh green coffee beans contribute to the unpleasant taste making it impossible to prepare a desirable beverage with such compounds. In fresh green coffee from Peru these concentrations have been determined as: isoleucine 81 mg/kg leucine 100 mg/kg valine 93 mg/kg tyrosine 81 mg/kg phenylalanine 133 mg/kg. The concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (a neurotransmitter) has been determined between 143 mg/kg and 703 mg/kg in green coffee beans from Tanzania. Roasted coffee beans do not contain any free amino acids; the amino acids in green coffee beans are degraded under roasting temperature to Maillard products (reaction products between the aldehyde group of sugar and the alpha-amino group of the amino acids). Further diketopiperazines e.g. cyclo(proline-proline) cyclo(proline-leucine) and cyclo(proline-isoleucine) are generated from the corresponding amino acids and are the major source of the bitter taste of roasted coffee. The bitter flavor of diketopiperazines is perceptible at around 20 mg/liter of water. The content of diketopiperazines in espresso is about 20 to 30 mg which is responsible for its bitterness.

===Carbohydrates===
Carbohydrates make up about 50% of the dry weight of green coffee beans. The carbohydrate fraction of green coffee is dominated by polysaccharides such as arabinogalactan galactomannan and cellulose contributing to the tasteless flavor of green coffee. Arabinogalactan makes up to 17% of dry weight of green coffee beans with a molecular weight of 90 kDa to 200 kDa. It is composed of beta-1-3-linked galactan main chains with frequent members of arabinose (pentose) and galactose (hexose) residues at the side chains comprising immunomodulating properties by stimulating the cellular defense system (Th-1 response) of the body. Mature brown to yellow coffee beans contain fewer residues of galactose and arabinose at the side chain of the polysaccharides making the green coffee bean more resistant to physical breakdown and less soluble in water. The molecular weight of the arabinogalactan in coffee is higher than in most other plants improving the cellular defense system of the digestive tract compared to arabinogalactan with lower molecular weight. Free monosaccharides are present in mature brown to yellow-green coffee beans. The free part of monosaccharides contains sucrose (gluco-fructose) up to 9000 mg/100g of arabica green coffee bean a lower amount in robustas i.e. 4500 mg/100g. In arabica green coffee beans the content of free glucose was 30 to 38 mg/100g free fructose 23 to 30 mg/100g; free galactose 35 mg/100g and mannitol 50 mg/100g dried coffee beans respectively. Mannitol is a powerful scavenger for hydroxyl radicals which are generated during the peroxidation of lipids in biological membranes.

===Lipids===
The lipids found in green coffee include: linoleic acid palmitic acid oleic acid stearic acid arachidic acid diterpenes triglycerides unsaturated long-chain fatty acids esters and amides. The total content of lipids in dried green coffee is between 11.7 and 14 g/100 g. Lipids are present on the surface and in the interior matrix of green coffee beans. On the surface they include derivatives of carboxylic acid-5-hydroxytryptamides with an amide bond to fatty acids (unsaturated C6 to C24) making up to 3% of total lipid content or 1200 to 1400 microgram/g dried green coffee bean. Such compounds form a wax-like cover on the surface of the coffee bean (200 to 300 mg lipids/100 g dried green coffee bean) protecting the interior matrix against oxidation and insects. Further such molecules have antioxidative activity due to their chemical structure. Lipids of the interior tissue are triglycerides linoleic acid (46% of total free lipids) palmitic acid (30% to 35% of total free lipids) and esters. Arabica beans have a higher content of lipids (13.5 to 17.4 g lipids/100 g dried green coffee beans) than robustas (9.8 to 10.7 g lipids/100 g dried green coffee beans). The content of diterpenes is about 20% of the lipid fraction. The diterpenes found in green coffee include cafestol kahweol 16-O-methylcafestol cafestal and kahweal. Some of these diterpenes have been shown in ''in vitro'' experiments to protect liver tissue against chemical oxidation. In coffee oil from green coffee beans the diterpenes are esterified with saturated long chain fatty acids.

===Nonvolatile chlorogenic acids===
Chlorogenic acids belong to a group of compounds known as phenolic acids which are antioxidants. The content of chlorogenic acids in dried green coffee beans of robusta is 65 mg/g and of arabica 140 mg/g depending on the timing of harvesting. At roasting temperature more than 70% of chlorogenic acids are destroyed leaving a residue less than 30 mg/g in the roasted coffee bean. In contrast to green coffee green tea contains an average of 85 mg/g polyphenols. These chlorogenic acids could be a valuable inexpensive source of antioxidants. Chlorogenic acids are homologous compounds comprising caffeic acid ferulic acid and 34-dimethoxycinnamic acid which are connected by an ester bond to the hydroxyl groups of quinic acid. The antioxidant capacity of chlorogenic acid is more potent than of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or mannitol which is a selective hydroxy-radical scavenger. Chlorogenic acids have a bitter taste in low concentrations such as 50 mg/l water. At higher concentrations of 1 g/l water they have a sour taste. Chlorogenic acids increase the solubility of caffeine and are important modulators of taste.

===Volatile compounds===
Volatile compounds of green coffee beans include short-chain fatty acids aldehydes and nitrogen-containing aromatic molecules such as derivatives of pyrazines (green-herbeaceous-earthy odor). Briefly such volatile compounds are responsible for the less pleasing odor and taste of green coffee versus roasted coffee. Commercial success was realized by Starbucks in creating Green Bean Refreshers using a process that primarily isolates the caffeine from the green beans but does not actually use steeped liquid from the beans. Many consumers experiment with creating green bean ""extract"" by steeping green coffee beans in hot water. Often the recommended times of steeping (20 minutes to 1 hour) extract too much caffeine to provide a pleasant taste. A steeping time of 12 minutes or under provides a more palatable liquid that can be used as a base for a drink containing more of the nutrients and less caffeine that using just isolated caffeine extract. The alkaline stock base that results can be paired with acidic or fruity extracts with or without sweetener to mask the vegetable-like taste of the extract.

When green coffee beans are roasted other molecules with the typical pleasant aroma of coffee are generated which are not present in fresh green coffee. During roasting the major part of the unpleasant-tasting volatile compounds are neutralised. Unfortunately other important molecules such as antioxidants and vitamins present in green coffee are destroyed. Volatile compounds with nauseating odor for humans have been identified including acetic acid (pungent unpleasant odor) propionic acid (odor of sour milk or butter) butanoic acid (odor of rancid butter present in green coffee with 2 mg/100 g coffee beans) pentanoic acid (unpleasant fruity flavor present in green coffee at 40 mg/100 g in coffee beans) hexanoic acid (fatty-rancid odor) heptanoic acid (fatty odor) octanoic acid (repulsive oily rancid odor); nonanoic acid (mild nut-like fatty odor); decanoic acid (sour repulsive odor) and derivatives of such fatty acids – 3-methyl-valeric acid (sour green-herbaceous unpleasant odor) acetaldehyde (pungent-nauseating odor even when highly diluted present in dried green coffee beans at concentrations of about 5 mg/kg) propanal (choking effect on respiratory system penetrating-nauseating) butanal (nauseating effect present in dried green coffee beans at 2 to 7 mg/kg) or pentanal (very repulsive nauseating effect).

157825,Ficus rubiginosa,Description,"Variegated foliage of a cultivar
A spreading densely-shading tree when mature ''F. rubiginosa'' may reach  or more in height although it rarely exceeds  in the Sydney region. The trunk is buttressed and can reach  in diameter. The bark is yellow-brown. It can also grow as on other plants as a hemiepiphyte or  high lithophyte. Alternately arranged on the stems the ovate (egg-shaped) obovate (reverse egg-shaped) or oval-shaped leaves are anywhere from  long and  wide on -long petioles (stalks that join the leaves to stems). They are smooth or bear tiny rusty hairs. There are 16 to 62 pairs of lateral veins that run off the midvein at an angle of 41.5–84.0° while distinct basal veins run off the midvein at an angle of 18.5–78.9°. As with all figs the fruit (fig) is actually an inverted inflorescence (compound flower) known as a syconium with tiny flowers arising from the fig's inner surface into a hollow cavity. ''F. rubiginosa'' is monoecious—both male and female flowers are found on the same plant and in fact in the same fruit although they mature at different times. Often growing in pairs the figs are yellow initially and measure  across. Ripening to red in colour they are tipped with a small nipple and on a  stalk. Fruits ripen throughout the year although more so in spring and summer. Some trees have ripe and unripe fruit at the same time.

It closely resembles its relative the Moreton Bay fig (''F. macrophylla''). Having similar ranges in the wild they are often confused. The smaller leaves shorter fruit stalks and rusty colour of the undersides of the leaves of ''F. rubiginosa'' are the easiest distinguishing features. It is also confused with the small-leaved fig (''F. obliqua'') the syconia of which are smaller measuring 4–12 mm long and 4–11 mm in diameter compared with 7–17 mm long and 8–17 mm diameter for ''F. rubiginosa''.

809777,Louis de la Corne Chevalier de la Corne,Introduction,"Louis de la Corne Chevalier de la Corne
'''Louis de la Corne''' or '''Louis Chapt Chevalier de la Corne''' (June 6 1703 – November 15 1761) was born at Fort Frontenac in what is now Kingston Ontario Canada and began his career in the colonial regular troops as a second ensign in 1722 and was made full ensign five years later.

He married in 1728 and began investing heavily in the commerce of the fur trade while continuing his military career. This was a common practice of the time. In the next few years both careers flourished. He received promotions to lieutenant and then captain six years later.

During King George's War he had serious combat experience in Acadia for which he was awarded the cross of Saint Louis in May 1749 for his actions at the Battle of Grand Pre. During Father Le Loutre's War he was involved in other hostile military operations as well as organizing militias amongst new settlers in new territories (see Battle at Chignecto).

In 1752 La Corne began a three-year appointment as the western commander of the ''poste de l’Ouest'' (the French name for the posts started by  Pierre Gaultier de Varennes et de La Vérendrye).

He succeeded Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre and set out in June 1753 with 57 men leaving his brother Luc de la Corne to coordinate additional resources. He crossed paths with Saint-Pierre north of Lake Superior and was briefed on what he would find in the west. During his tenure in the west La Corne appears to have been an active commander. He improved Fort Paskoya (Le Pas Man.) built Fort Saint-Louis (Fort de la Corne Saskatchewan) and explored the Carrot River valley. He was succeeded by Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La Vérendrye who was Commander of the West from 1756 to 1758. (Because of the Seven Years' War  La Vérendrye never actually came west but carried out the business through agents.)
Cross of Saint Louis for La Corne's victory in the Battle of Grand Pre
By July 1755 La Corne was back east and was heavily involved in military matters for the next five years patrolling the Montreal to Lake Ontario waterway with a large contingent of men. More military recognition for his role was recommended but never occurred. He was to be deported to France in 1761 and was one of the victims when the ship ''Auguste'' sank off the coast of Cape Breton Island on November 15 of that year.

524578,Rififi,Critical reception,"Upon its original release film critic and future director François Truffaut praised the film stating that ""Out of the worst crime novels I ever read Jules Dassin has made the best crime film I've ever seen"" and ""Everything in ''Le Rififi'' is intelligent: screenplay dialogue sets music choice of actors. Jean Servais Robert Manuel and Jules Dassin are perfect."" French critic André Bazin said that ''Rififi'' brought the genre a ""sincerity and humanity that break with the conventions of a crime film and manage to touch our hearts"". In the February 1956 issue of the French film magazine ''Cahiers du cinéma'' the film was listed as number thirteen in the top twenty films of 1955. The film was well received by British critics who noted the film's violence on its initial release. ''The Daily Mirror'' referred to the film as ""brilliant and brutal"" while the ''Daily Herald'' made note that ''Rififi'' would ""make American attempts at screen brutality look like a tea party in cathedral city"". The American release of the film also received acclaim. Bosley Crowther of ''The New York Times'' referred to the film as ""perhaps the keenest crime film that ever came from France including ""''Pepe le Moko''"" and some of the best of Louis Jouvet and Jean Gabin."" The National Board of Review nominated the film as the Best Foreign Film in 1956.

''Rififi'' was re-released for a limited run within America on 21 July 2000 in a new 35 mm print containing new more explicit subtitles that were enhanced in collaboration with Dassin. The film was received very well by American critics on its re-release. The film ranking website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 93% of critics had given the film positive reviews based upon a sample of 41. At Metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics the film has received an average score of 97 based on 13 reviews.
Kenneth Turan of the ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote the film was the ""benchmark all succeeding heist films have been measured against... It's a film whose influence is hard to overstate one that proves for not the last time that it's easier to break into a safe than fathom the mysteries of the human heart."" Lucia Bozzola of the online database Allmovie gave the film the highest possible rating of five stars calling it ""The pinnacle of heist movies"" and ""not only one of the best French noirs but one of the top movies in the genre."" In 2002 critic Roger Ebert added the film to his list of ""Great Movies"" stating ""echoes of ''Rififi'' can be found from Kubrick's ""''The Killing''"" to Tarantino's ""''Reservoir Dogs''."" They both owe something to John Huston's ""''The Asphalt Jungle''"" (1950) which has the general idea but not the attention to detail."" Among negative reviews of the film Dave Kehr of the ''Chicago Reader'' felt that ""the film turns moralistic and sour in the last half when the thieves fall out."" ''Rififi'' placed at number 90 on ''Empire'''s list of The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema. Critic and director Jean-Luc Godard regarded the film negatively in comparison to other French crime films of the era noting in 1986 that ""today it can't hold a candle to ''Touchez pas au grisbi'' which paved the way for it let alone ''Bob le flambeur'' which it paved the way for.""

The high cliff on the west side of Gjegnen mountain. It is called ""Galleriet"". The cliff is from the west side of Gjegnen to Bjørndalsvatnet.
Bremanger is located along the south side of the Nordfjorden.  Most of the municipality is on the mainland but there are many islands that are also part of the municipality including Bremangerlandet Rugsundøya and Frøya the three largest.  These islands are separated from the mainland by the Frøysjøen strait.

Bremanger is bordered to the north by the municipalities of Vågsøy and Eid (across the fjord) to the east by Gloppen to the south by Flora and to the west by the North Sea.  The Frøysjøen is the sea between the mainland and the main islands of Bremangerlandet and Frøya.  The Gulen fjord branches off of the Frøysjøen and that fjord splits off into the Nordgulen Midtgulen and Sørgulen.  On the east end of the municipality is the Isefjord and Ålfotfjorden.

165981,Flag (linear algebra),Bases,"An ordered basis for ''V'' is said to be adapted to a flag if the first ''d''''i'' basis vectors form a basis for ''V''''i'' for each 0 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''k''. Standard arguments from linear algebra can show that any flag has an adapted basis.

Any ordered basis gives rise to a complete flag by letting the ''V''''i'' be the span of the first ''i'' basis vectors. For example the '''''' in '''R'''''n'' is induced from the standard basis (''e''1 ... ''e''''n'') where ''e''''i'' denotes the vector with a 1 in the ''i''th slot and 0's elsewhere. Concretely the standard flag is the subspaces:
:

An adapted basis is almost never unique (trivial counterexamples); see below.

A complete flag on an inner product space has an essentially unique orthonormal basis: it is unique up to multiplying each vector by a unit (scalar of unit length like 1 -1 ''i''). This is easiest to prove inductively by noting that  which defines it uniquely up to unit.

More abstractly it is unique up to an action of the maximal torus: the flag corresponds to the Borel group and the inner product corresponds to the maximal compact subgroup.

645967,Delarivier Manley,Life,"===Early life and theatrical writings===
Much of what is known about Manley is rooted in her insertion of ""Delia's story"" in the ''New Atalantis'' (1709) and the ''Adventures of Rivella'' that she published as the biography of the author of the ''Atalantis'' with Edmund Curll in 1714. Curll added further details on the publication history behind the ''Rivella'' in the first posthumous edition of the quasi-fictional and not entirely-reliable autobiography in 1725.

Manley was probably born in Jersey the third of six children of Sir Roger Manley a royalist army officer and historian and a woman from the Spanish Netherlands who died when Delarivier was young. It seems that she and her sister Cornelia moved with their father to his various army postings.

After their father's death in 1687 the young women became wards of their cousin John Manley (1654–1713) a Tory MP. John Manley had married a Cornish heiress and later bigamously married Delarivier. They had a son in 1691 also named John. In January 1694 Manley left her husband and went to live with Barbara Villiers the 1st Duchess of Cleveland at one time the mistress of Charles II. She remained there only six months at which time she was expelled by the duchess for allegedly flirting with her son. There is some indication that she may have been by then reconciled with her husband for a time.

From 1694 to 1696 Manley travelled extensively in England principally in the southwest and began her dramatic career. At this time she wrote her first play a comedy ''The Lost Lover or The Jealous Husband'' (1696) and the she-tragedy ''The Royal Mischief'' (1696) which became the subject of ridicule and inspired the anonymous satirical play ''The Female Wits.'' The satire mocked three female playwrights including Manley Catharine Trotter and Mary Pix. Manley retired from the stage for ten years before returning with her 1707 play ''Almyna or The Arabian Vow''. Ten years later Manley's ''Lucius The First King of Britain'' was staged. 

German edition of Manley's ''Atalantis'' 1713

===Her political satires===
Manley became well-known even notorious as a novel with the publication of her roman à clef the ''New Atalantis'' in 1709 a work that spotted present British politics on the fabulous Mediterranean Island.  Contemporary critics like Swift might consider that her caricatures missed the mark much more often than they hit it; but a historian like G. M. Trevelyan would at least rate her portrait of Godolphin as a telling one: “...the greatest genius of his age with the least of it in his aspect. The affairs of a nation in his head with a pair of cards or a box of dice in his hand”.

Such was the scandal the work produced that Manley was arrested and immediately questioned by the authorities in preparation of a libel case against her. She had discredited half the arena of ruling Whig politicians as well as moderate Tories like John Churchill 1st Duke of Marlborough who she said had begun his career at court in the bed of the royal mistress Barbara Villiers.  Manley resolutely denied all correspondencies between her characters and real people and the charges were eventually dropped: part of the difficulty of those offended was proving that she had actually told their stories without exposing themselves to further ridicule.  Manley's semi-autobiographical ''Adventures of Rivella'' repeated the claim that her work was entirely fictional.

The result was a tacit agreement as to the fictional status of her works  under cover of which she continued to publish another volume of the ''Atalantis'' and two more of the ''Memoirs of Europe''. The latter found a different fictional setting to allow the wider European picture. Later editions sold the ''Memoirs'' however as volumes three and four of the ''Atalantis'' which also came to incorporate the earlier skit the ''Secret History of Queen Zarah''; while the ''Atalantis'' also sparked several imitations by others.  

Meanwhile with the Tory electoral victory of 1710  Manley came to collaborate with Swift in a number of pro-Tory pamphlets and also took over the editorship of ''The Examiner'' from him.  Her satirical attacks on the Whigs resulted in a payment from the new Prime Minister Robert Harley 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer; but with the accession of George I and the ensuing Tory collapse her position disintegrated as a begging letter to Harley reveals: “I have nothing but a starveling scene before me Lord Marlborough and all his accomplices justly enraged against me. Nothing saved from the wreck”.

===Later writings===

Manley however was a resilient figure. In 1714 she had been threatened with being the object of a biographical text planned by Charles Gildon but Curll Gildon's prospective publisher warned Manley of the work in progress. She contacted Gildon and arranged for an agreement: she would write the work in question herself within a certain time span. The result were her ''Adventures of Rivella'' a book evolving between two male protagonists: the young chevalier D'Aumont has left France to have sex with the author and finds a rejected lover and friend who does not only offer his assistance in arranging the contact but also tells the story of her life both as related in public gossip and as only her friends know it.  In this work Manley has been seen as repositioning herself politically as a more moderate figure in preparation for the power shifts to come; and it may be significant that it was a Whig Richard Steele who was later to produce her lucrative drama ''Lucius'' in 1717.

Her last major work ''The Power of Love in Seven Novels'' (London: J. Barber/ J. Morphew 1720) was a revised version of selected novellas first published in William Painter's ''Palace of Pleasure well furnished with pleasaunt Histories and excellent Novelles'' (1566).

Manley died at Barber's Printing House on Lambeth Hill after a violent fit of the cholic which lasted five days. Her body was interred in the middle aisle of the Church of St Benet at Paul's-Wharf where on a marble gravestone is the following inscription to her memory:

""Here lieth the body of

Mrs. ''Delarivier Manley''

Daughter of Sir ''Roger Manley'' Knight

Who suitable to her birth and education

Was acquainted with several Parts of Knowledge

And with the most polite Writers both in the ''French'' and ''English'' tongue.

This Accomplishment

Together with a greater Natural Stock of Wit made her Conversation agreeable to all who knew Her and her Writings to be universally Read with Pleasure.

She died ''July'' 11th 1724.""

Lie a foreign minister and former labour leader was recommended by the Soviet Union to fill the post. After the UN involvement in the Korean War the Soviet Union vetoed Lie's reappointment in 1951. The United States circumvented the Soviet Union's veto and recommended reappointment directly to the General Assembly. Lie was reappointed by a vote of 46 to 5 with eight abstentions. The Soviet Union remained hostile to Lie and he resigned in 1952.

'''Dag Hammarskjöld'''(1905–1961)80px




Western European & Others

Died in a plane crash in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) while on a peacekeeping mission to the Congo.





After a series of candidates were vetoed Hammarskjöld emerged as an option that was acceptable to the Security Council. He was re-elected unanimously to a second term in 1957. The Soviet Union was angered by Hammarskjöld's leadership of the UN during the Congo Crisis and suggested that the position of Secretary-General be replaced by a troika or three-man executive. Facing great opposition from the Western nations the Soviet Union gave up on its suggestion. Hammarskjöld was killed in a plane crash in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) in 1961. U.S. President John F. Kennedy called Hammarskjöld ""the greatest statesman of our century"".

 '''U Thant'''(1909–1974)80px




Asia-Pacific

Declined to stand for a third election.





In the process of replacing Hammarskjöld the developing world insisted on a non-European and non-American Secretary-General. U Thant was nominated. However due to opposition from the French (Thant had chaired a committee on Algerian independence) and the Arabs (Burma supported Israel) Thant was only appointed for the remainder of Hammarskjöld's term. He was the first Asian Secretary-General. The following year on 30 November Thant was unanimously re-elected to a new term ending on 3 November 1966. He was re-elected on 2 December 1966 finally for a full 5-year term ending on 31 December 1971. Thant did not seek a third election.

In 1976 China initially blocked Waldheim's re-election but it relented on the second ballot. In 1981 Waldheim's re-election for a third term was blocked by China which vetoed his selection through 15 rounds. From 1986 to 1992 Waldheim served as President of Austria making him the first head of state to rise to the position of Secretary-General of the United Nations. In 1985 it was revealed that a post–World War II UN War Crimes Commission had labeled Waldheim as a suspected war criminal – based on his involvement with the army of Nazi Germany. The files had been stored in the UN archive.

Pérez de Cuéllar was selected after a five-week deadlock between the re-election of Waldheim and China's candidate Salim Ahmed Salim of Tanzania. Pérez de Cuéllar a Peruvian diplomat who a decade earlier had served as President of the UN Security Council during his time as Peruvian Ambassador to the UN was a compromise candidate and became the first and thus far only Secretary-General from the Americas.

4886,Essay,Non-literary types,"
===Film===
A film essay (or ""cinematic essay"") consists of the evolution of a theme or an idea rather than a plot per se or the film literally being a cinematic accompaniment to a narrator reading an essay. From another perspective an essay film could be defined as a documentary film visual basis combined with a form of commentary that contains elements of self-portrait (rather than autobiography) where the signature (rather than the life story) of the filmmaker is apparent. The cinematic essay often blends documentary fiction and experimental film making using tones and editing styles.

The genre is not well-defined but might include propaganda works of early Soviet parliamentarians like Dziga Vertov present-day filmmakers including Chris Marker Michael Moore (''Roger & Me'' (1989) ''Bowling for Columbine'' (2002) and ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' (2004)) Errol Morris (''The Thin Blue Line'' (1988)) Morgan Spurlock (''Supersize Me: A Film of Epic Proportions'') and  Agnès Varda. Jean-Luc Godard describes his recent work as ""film-essays"". Two filmmakers whose work was the antecedent to the cinematic essay include Georges Méliès and Bertolt Brecht.  Méliès made a short film (''The Coronation of Edward VII'' (1902)) about the 1902 coronation of King Edward VII which mixes actual footage with shots of a recreation of the event. Brecht was a playwright who experimented with film and incorporated film projections into some of his plays.  Orson Welles made an essay film in his own pioneering style released in 1974 called ''F for Fake'' which dealt specifically with art forger Elmyr de Hory and with the themes of deception ""fakery"" and authenticity in general.  These are often published online on video hosting services.

David Winks Gray's article ""The essay film in action"" states that the ""essay film became an identifiable form of filmmaking in the 1950s and '60s"". He states that since that time essay films have tended to be ""on the margins"" of the filmmaking the world. Essay films have a ""peculiar searching questioning tone ... between documentary and fiction"" but without ""fitting comfortably"" into either genre. Gray notes that just like written essays essay films ""tend to marry the personal voice of a guiding narrator (often the director) with a wide swath of other voices"". The University of Wisconsin Cinematheque website echoes some of Gray's comments; it calls a film essay an ""intimate and allusive"" genre that ""catches filmmakers in a pensive mood ruminating on the margins between fiction and documentary"" in a manner that is ""refreshingly inventive playful and idiosyncratic"".

===Music===
In the realm of music composer Samuel Barber wrote a set of ""Essays for Orchestra"" relying on the form and content of the music to guide the listener's ear rather than any extra-musical plot or story.

===Photography===
""After School Play Interrupted by the Catch and Release of a Stingray"" is a simple time-sequence photo essay.

A photographic essay strives to cover a topic with a linked series of photographs. Photo essays range from purely photographic works to photographs with captions or small notes to full-text essays with a few or many accompanying photographs. Photo essays can be sequential in nature intended to be viewed in a particular order — or they may consist of non-ordered photographs viewed all at once or in an order that the viewer chooses. All photo essays are collections of photographs but not all collections of photographs are photo essays. Photo essays often address a certain issue or attempt to capture the character of places and events.


===Visual Arts===
In the visual arts an essay is a preliminary drawing or sketch that forms a basis for a final painting or sculpture made as a test of the work's composition (this meaning of the term like several of those following comes from the word ''essayJA's meaning of ""attempt"" or ""trial"").

411054,Tom Otterness,Introduction,"

'''Tom Otterness''' (born 1952) is an American sculptor best known as one of America’s most prolific public artists. Otterness's works adorn parks plazas subway stations libraries courthouses and museums in New York City—most notably in Rockefeller Park in  Battery Park City and ''Life Underground'' in the 14th Street – Eighth Avenue New York City Subway station—and other cities around the world. He contributed a balloon (a giant upside-down Humpty Dumpty) to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. In 1994 he was elected as a member of the National Academy Museum.

647515,Giant petrel,Behaviour,"
===Feeding===

Petrels are highly opportunistic feeders. Uniquely among procellarids they will feed on land as well as at sea; in fact they find most of their food near the coast. On land they feed on carrion particularly that of seals and penguins. They also display their dominance over carcasses with a ""sealmaster posture"": the head and the wings are held outstretched the head pointing at the opponent and the wingtips pointing slightly back; the tail is raised to a vertical position. They are also capable of killing other seabirds even those as large as an albatross which they kill either by battering them to death (most commonly chicks of other species during the breeding season) or drowning. At sea they feed on krill squid and fish often following fishing fleets in the hope of picking up offal. 
Giant petrel with chick in thumb

===Reproduction===
The southern giant petrel is more likely to form loose colonies than the northern both species laying a single egg in a rough nest built about  off the ground. The egg is incubated for about 60 days once hatched the chick is brooded for 3 weeks. Chicks fledge after about 4 months but do not achieve sexual maturity for another 6–7 years after fledging.

529515,Vehicle-to-grid,Backup power solutions,"
Future battery developments
may change the economic equation making it advantageous to use newer high capacity and longer-lived batteries in BEV/PHEVs. These newer batteries can be used in grid load balancing and as a large energy cache for renewable grid resources. Since BEVs can have up to 50 kWh worth of battery storage they represent somewhat more than the average home's daily energy demand. Even without a PHEV's gas generation capabilities such a vehicle could be used for emergency power for several days (for example lighting home appliances etc. with combined load of 1 kW could be powered for 50 hours). This would be an example of Vehicle-to-home transmission (V2H).  As such they may be seen as a complementary technology for intermittent renewable power resources such as wind or solar electric.

'''FC Dinamo Tbilisi''' () is a professional football club based in Tbilisi Georgia that competes in the Erovnuli Liga the top flight of Georgian football.

Dinamo Tbilisi was one of the most prominent clubs in Soviet football and a major contender in the Soviet Top League almost immediately after it was established in 1936. The club was then part of one of the leading sport societies in the Soviet Union the All-Union Dynamo sports society which had several other divisions besides football and was sponsored by the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs.

Iberia) founded and edited by Chavchavadze during his political career. The newspaper focused on the national liberation movement of Georgia in the late 1800s.
Ilia's main political and social goals were based on Georgian patriotism. He radically advocated the revival of the use of the Georgian language the cultivation of Georgian literature the revival of autocephalous status for the Georgian national church and finally the revival of Georgian statehood which had ended when the country became part of the Russian Empire. As the number of supporters for his ideas grew so did opposition among the leading Social Democrats like the Menshevik Noe Zhordania; their main aims were focused on battling the Tsarist autocracy and a democratic transformation of the Russian empire. This did not include the revival of a Georgian state or of a Georgian self-identity. Ilia was viewed as bourgeois and as an old aristocrat who failed to realize the importance of the revolutionary tide.

In addition to his works described above he was also the founder and chairman of many public cultural and educational organizations (Society for the Spreading of Literacy Among Georgians ""The Bank of the Nobility"" ""The Dramatic Society"" ""The Historical-Ethnographical Society of Georgia"" etc.). He was also a translator of British literature. His main literary works were translated and published in French English German Polish Ukrainian Belarusian Russian and other languages. Between 1906 and 1907 he was a member of the State Council (Gosudarstvennaya Duma) in Russia. His eclectic interests also led him to be a member of among others the Caucasian Committee of the Geographical Society of Russia the Society of Ethnography and Anthropology of Moscow University the Society of Orientalists of Russia and the Anglo-Russian Literary Society (London).

Prince Chavchavadze briefly acted as a literary mentor to a young Joseph Stalin who was then an Orthodox seminarian in Tbilisi. According to historian Simon Sebag Montefiore ""The Prince was sufficiently impressed to show the teenagers work to his editors. He admired Stalin's verse choosing five poems to publish – quite an achievement. Prince Chavchavadze called Stalin the 'young man with the burning eyes.'""

784955,Corbel arch,Introduction,"Basic principle of corbeled arch design.
Comparison of  a ''corbel arch'' (right) and  a generic ""true"" stone ''arch'' (left).

A '''corbel arch''' (or '''corbeled / corbelled arch''') is an arch-like construction method that uses the architectural technique of corbeling to span a space or void in a structure such as an entranceway in a wall or as the span of a bridge. A '''corbel vault''' uses this technique to support the superstructure of a building's roof.

A corbel arch is constructed by offsetting successive courses of stone (or brick) at the springline of the walls so that they project towards the archway's center from each supporting side until the courses meet at the apex of the archway (often the last gap is bridged with a flat stone). For a corbeled vault covering the technique is extended in three dimensions along the lengths of two opposing walls.
Royal Palace of Ugarit Entrance
Although an improvement in load-bearing efficiency over the post and lintel design corbeled arches are not entirely self-supporting structures and the corbeled arch is sometimes termed a ""false arch"" for this reason. Unlike ""true"" arches not all of the structure's tensile stresses caused by the weight of the superstructure are transformed into compressive stresses. Corbel arches and vaults require significantly thickened walls and an abutment of other stone or fill to counteract the effects of gravity which otherwise would tend to collapse each side of the archway inwards.

597452,Bully (video game),Development,"Rockstar announced ''Bully'' on May 2005 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox with an original expected release date of October 2005. Early information released by Take-Two Interactive seemed to indicate that the player would be taking the role of a bully and screenshots printed in ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' showed the player-controlled antagonist administering a ""swirlie"" and throwing a punch at another student. However the tone of the final game was different with the player in the role of a problem student who stood up to and fought back against bullies in effect bullying on behalf of the victims or in self-defense.

The PlayStation 2 version of the game uses an advanced ''Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'' engine through RenderWare. Rockstar Vancouver also decided to make every student in the school have a unique appearance and personality.

When developing the characters the team aimed at recreating the state of being a child and making it enjoyable. Parallels were made between Jimmy and ''Catcher in the Rye''s Holden Caulfield. Jimmy and Holden share a background of a difficult homelife and being thrown out of multiple private schools.
Though the pompous school principal Dr. Crabblesnitch is originally introduced as the main nemesis this role is later replaced by Gary Smith who initially befriends Jimmy. Gary is described as a sociopath. He admits that he suffers from attention-deficit disorder and is also a narcissist as he considers himself smarter and better than everyone and wants to run the school.

The originally announced Xbox version was silently cancelled during development.

===  ''Scholarship Edition'' ===
On 19 July 2007 Rockstar announced that a remaster would be released for the Wii and Xbox 360 subtitled ''Scholarship Edition''. Rockstar New England then called Mad Doc Software led development with the Xbox 360 version while Rockstar Toronto ported it to the Wii. The Wii and Xbox 360 versions were released on 4 March 2008. A Microsoft Windows port was later developed by Rockstar New England and released on 21 October 2008. The game features exclusive content which is unavailable in the original version including new missions characters school classes and unlockable items and clothing. Some small script changes have been made and the highly compressed voice files of the original have been replaced with higher-quality versions. The random NPCs also have more lines. In addition single system two-player competitive multiplayer minigames have also been added along with Achievements for the Xbox 360 version and Wii Remote and Nunchuk motion and pointer controls for the Wii version. All ports of the ''Scholarship Edition'' use the game engine Gamebryo rather than Renderware which was used for the original version.

672172,Adalbert Gyrowetz,Biography,"Gyrowetz was born 20 February 1763 in České Budějovice (Budweis). His father was the choirmaster in the cathedral there and Adalbert first studied with him. He then travelled to Prague where he studied law but continued to learn music.

At around this time Gyrowetz was in the employ of Count Franz von Fünfkirchen in Brno whose employees were all musicians. Here he started composing (among other things) symphonies of which he was eventually to write more than 60. In 1785 he moved to Vienna and met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart who performed one of Gyrowetz's symphonies in the same year.
From 1786 to around 1793 he travelled throughout Europe. He spent some time in Paris where he established that some symphonies that had been published as the work of Joseph Haydn were in fact his work.  He spent three years in Italy meeting Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in Rome and studying with Nicola Sala in Naples. In 1791 he met Haydn whom he idolized in London. While in London he was commissioned by Johann Peter Salomon to compose symphonies to be performed at Salomon's Hanover Square Rooms concerts.

Gyrowetz moved back to Vienna and in 1804 was appointed Vice-kapellmeister of the Court Theatre. Gyrowetz was an important part of Viennese musical society well into the 1820s and even arranged the piano reduction of Rossini's ''Zelmira'' in 1822. He was one of the pallbearers at Beethoven's funeral in 1827. Gyrowetz died 19 March 1850 in Vienna.

442795,The Set-Up (1949 film),Plot,"Bill ""Stoker"" Thompson (Robert Ryan) is a 35-year-old has-been boxer about to take on an opponent at the fictional Paradise City Arena. His wife Julie (Audrey Totter) fears that this fight may be his last and wants him to forfeit the match. Tiny (George Tobias) Stoker's manager is sure he will continue to lose fights so he takes money for a ""dive"" from a mobster but is so certain of Stoker's failure that he does not inform the boxer of the set-up.

The beginning of the film shows Stoker and Julie in their room at the Hotel Cozy passionately debating whether he should participate in the fight. Julie tells him that she has a headache and won't attend the match. Stoker claims the $500 prize could allow them to buy a cigar stand or invest in another boxer Tony Martinez and start a new life. Julie says she cares more about his well-being than money but Stoker responds: ""If you're a fighter you gotta fight.""

After Stoker departs for the arena Julie continues to struggle with her fear and desire to support him but ultimately ends up not using her ticket to the event and instead roams the streets surrounding the arena.

At the beginning of the fourth and last round of the vicious match with the much younger and heavily favored Tiger Nelson (Hal Fieberling) Stoker learns about the fix. Even though he is told that Little Boy (Alan Baxter) a feared gangster is behind the set-up he refuses to give up the fight.

Stoker wins the vocal support of blood-thirsty fans who had at first rooted against him and ends up defeating his opponent. He pays for his decision with a beating in an alley outside the arena from Little Boy Tiger Nelson and their cronies. The group irreparably damages Stoker's hand with a smash from a brick.

The story closes with Julie meeting Stoker as he staggers out of the alley and collapses into her arms. ""I won tonight"" he tells her. ""Yes"" she answers. ""You won tonight. We both won tonight.""

531573,Amphionides,Description,"''Amphionides'' grows to a length of . Morphologically ''Amphionides'' is somewhat unusual with many body parts being reduced or absent. For example it has only one pair of mouthparts – the maxillae – the mandibles and maxillules being vestigial.

Males and females differ in the form of the antennae and also by the presence in males of the eighth thoracic appendage albeit in a reduced form. This is the site of the male gonopore (the female's gonopore is on the sixth thoracic appendage). The first pleopod of the female is greatly enlarged and almost encloses the enlarged carapace. This is assumed to be a chamber in which the eggs are fertilised and retained until hatching. The more streamlined carapace and pleopods of the male make it more hydrodynamic and so fewer males are caught than females.

231146,The Amboy Dukes,Origins,"Ted Nugent the nucleus of The Amboy Dukes was born and raised in Detroit and started performing in 1958 at age 10. He played in a group called The Royal High Boys from 1960 to 1962 and later in group named The Lourds where he first met future Amboy Dukes lead vocalist John Drake. Nugent played with The Lourds until his family moved to Illinois where he founded The Amboy Dukes in the Chicago area in 1964 playing at The Cellar in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights among other venues. They later relocated to Nugent's hometown of Detroit. The members included the following:

*Ted Nugent (lead guitar)
*Bob Lehnert (vocalist) - who released a single ""Better Than Today"" with the band Acrobat in 1972.
*Gary Hicks (guitar vocals)
*Dick Treat (bass vocals)
*Gail Uptadale (drums)

The above lineup did not release any recordings. Nugent's early guitar playing style with his signature Gibson Byrdland positioned high on his chest became an iconic playing style that visually differentiated him from other players. He combined this with his natural virtuosity and frenzied playing style on lead adding a sonic differentiation to his unusual visual approach. This gave him an edge as a performance artist. Nugent's appreciation for his guitar inspired him to compose the song ""Flight of the Byrd"" which was released as a single and as part of their most popular album ''Journey to the Center of the Mind''.

276169,Korona Kielce,Stadium,"
Stadium of Korona Kielce

In response to Korona's successes and the club owner Krzysztof Klicki's affirmation that the club would play in the premier league and battle for European cups Kielce municipal authorities approved the construction of a new stadium. Unfortunately the stadium turned out to be much too small. Because of this the club played its first round in the highest division at its old stadium (currently used by reserves and youth teams) to permit further work on the new facility.

Only eighteen months after the start of the building project the keys of the new stadium were officially handed to the club. The first premier league match was played on 1 April 2006 against Zagłębie Lubin.

The Korona stadium although it stands on the same site as an earlier stadium is an entirely new facility built according to UEFA recommendations and modern design ideas. In this way it differs from most other football stadiums in Poland which were built during the communist era or earlier and only slightly modernized to meet basic UEFA standards.

Kielce stadium can seat 15550 fans however due to Polish regulations which require a buffer zone between local fans and the visitors section league matches can only accommodate 13823 Korona fans and 777 visiting fans. However on one occasion the stadium was full to capacity during a league match. This occurred during the 2006–07 season when fans of visiting club Legia Warszawa were prohibited from entering due to the vast number of their 'red brigade' supporters who made the trip down to watch their club in Kielce.

Pitch dimensions are 105 x 68 m and the entire surface is heated. Automatic sprinklers water the pitch in between match days. Kielce stadium has a complete system of monitoring which could serve as a model for other Polish stadiums. Korona's stadium is also considered by the Polish Football Association for international games.

Since 2006 when the club moved to the most modern stadium in Poland it often had among the best attendance statistics in the Polish league although these numbers have declined since the club's relegation at the end of the 2007–08 season.

88200,Port wine,Region and production,"The vineyards that produce port wine are common along the hillsides that flank the valley of the River Douro in northern Portugal.

Port is produced from grapes grown and processed in the demarcated Douro region. The wine produced is then fortified by the addition of a neutral grape spirit known as aguardente in order to stop the fermentation leaving residual sugar in the wine and to boost the alcohol content. The fortification spirit is sometimes referred to as brandy but it bears little resemblance to commercial brandies. The wine is then stored and aged often in barrels stored in a ''Lodge'' (meaning ""cellar"") as is the case in Vila Nova de Gaia before being bottled. The wine received its name ""port"" in the later half of the 17th century from the seaport city of Porto at the mouth of the Douro River where much of the product was brought to market or for export to other countries in Europe. The Douro valley where port wine is produced was defined and established as a protected region or appellation in 1756 making it the third oldest after Chianti (1716) and Tokaj (1730).

The reaches of the valley of the Douro River in northern Portugal have a microclimate that is optimal for cultivation of olives almonds and especially grapes important for making port wine. The region around Pinhão and São João da Pesqueira is considered to be the centre of port production and is known for its picturesque ''quintas''— estates clinging on to almost vertical slopes dropping down to the river.

===Wine regions===
The demarcation of the Douro River Valley includes a broad swath of land of pre-Cambrian schist and granite. Beginning around the village of Barqueiros (about  upstream from Porto) the valley extends eastward almost to the Spanish border. The region is protected from the influences of the Atlantic Ocean by the Serra do Marão mountains. The area is sub-divided into three official zones: the Baixo (lower) Corgo the Cima (higher) Corgo and the Douro Superior.
* '''Baixo Corgo''' – The westernmost zone located downstream from the river Corgo centred on the municipality of Peso da Régua. This region is the wettest port production zone receiving an annual average of 900 mm and has the coolest average temperature of the three zones. The grapes grown here are used mainly for the production of inexpensive ruby and tawny ports.
* '''Cima Corgo''' – Located upstream from the Baixo Corgo this region is centred on the town of Pinhão (municipality of Alijó). The summertime average temperature of the region is a few degrees higher and annual rainfall is about 200 mm less. The grapes grown in this zone are considered of higher quality being used in bottlings of Vintage Reserve aged Tawny and Late Bottled Vintage Ports.
* '''Douro Superior''' – The easternmost zone extending almost to the Spanish border. This is the least cultivated region of Douro due in part to the difficulties of navigating the river past the rapids of Cachão da Valeira. This is the most arid and warmest region of the Douro. The overall terrain is relatively flat with the potential for mechanization.

===Grapes===

Over a hundred varieties of grapes (''castas'') are sanctioned for port production although only five (Tinta Barroca Tinta Cão Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo) Touriga Francesa and Touriga Nacional) are widely cultivated and used. Touriga Nacional is widely considered the most desirable port grape but the difficulty in growing it and the small yields cause Touriga Francesa to be the most widely planted grape. White ports are produced the same way as red ports except that they use white grapes—Donzelinho Branco Esgana-Cão Folgasão Gouveio Malvasia Fina Rabigato and Viosinho. While a few shippers have experimented with Ports produced from a single variety of grapes all Ports commercially available are from a blend of different grapes. Since the Phylloxera crisis most vines are grown on grafted rootstock with the notable exception of the Nacional area of Quinta do Noval which since being planted in 1925 has produced some of the most expensive vintage ports.

Grapes grown for port are generally characterised by their small dense fruit which produce concentrated and long-lasting flavours suitable for long aging. While the grapes used to produce port produced in Portugal are strictly regulated by the Instituto do Vinho do Porto wines from outside this region which describe themselves as port may be made from other varieties.

===Sales===
In 2013 there were 8.7 million cases of port sold 3.6% less than the previous year at a value of $499 million. Port sales have been declining since 2005 and are down 16% from that year. Declining sales are attributed by some to increasing prices due to the increased cost of alcohol used in the production process. Declining sales have been attributed to the global rise in alcohol levels of table wines. As of 2014 the leading brand in Portugal is Cálem which sells 2.6 million bottles annually.

===Transport===
A barco rabelo carrying some Port wine barrels.
While port is produced from grapes grown in the Douro valley until 1986 it could only be exported from Portugal from Vila Nova de Gaia near Porto Portugal's second-largest city. Traditionally the wine was taken downriver in flat-bottom boats called 'barcos rabelos' to be processed and stored. However in the 1950s and 1960s several hydroelectric power dams were built along the river ending this traditional conveyance down the river. Currently the wine is transported from the vineyards by tanker trucks and the ''barcos rabelos'' are only used for racing and other displays.

2294,Telecommunications in Canada,Telegraphy,"

The history of telegraphy in Canada dates back to the Province of Canada.  While the first telegraph company was the Toronto Hamilton and Niagara Electro-Magnetic Telegraph Company founded in 1846 it was the Montreal Telegraph Company controlled by Hugh Allan and founded a year later that dominated in Canada during the technology's early years.

Following the 1852 Telegraph Act Canada's first permanent transatlantic telegraph link was a submarine cable built in 1866 between Ireland and Newfoundland.Telegrams were sent through networks built by Canadian Pacific and Canadian National.

In 1868 Montreal Telegraph began facing competition from the newly established Dominion Telegraph Company. 1880 saw the Great North Western Telegraph Company established to connect Ontario and Manitoba but within a year it was taken over by Western Union leading briefly to that company's control of almost all telegraphy in Canada.  In 1882 Canadian Pacific transmitted its first commercial telegram over telegraph lines they had erected alongside its tracks breaking Western Union's monopoly. Great North Western Telegraph facing bankruptcy was taken over in 1915 by Canadian Northern.

By the end of World War II Canadians communicated by telephone more than any other country.  In 1967 the CP and CN networks were merged to form CNCP Telecommunications.

As of 1951 approximately 7000 messages were sent daily from the United States to Canada.  An agreement with Western Union required that U.S. company to route messages in a specified ratio of 3:1 with three telegraphic messages transmitted to Canadian National for every message transmitted to Canadian Pacific. The agreement was complicated by the fact that some Canadian destinations were served by only one of the two networks.

He was a member of the American Society of Composers Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) from which he received an annual award for achievement in serious music since 1962.

His music has been performed by many ensembles including the National Symphony Orchestra Oklahoma City Symphony Eastman-Rochester Orchestra and the Eastman Wind Ensemble. His ''Chamber Symphony'' of 1954 was commissioned by the Koussevitzky Foundation; his ''Concert Overture'' for orchestra received a prize from the National Symphony Orchestra in 1955; and his Sinfonia No. 3 for brass choir won for him the 1964 Conn Award. Since then he had received many commissions from college and high school musical organizations. A lately published orchestral work Symphony No. 3 was commissioned by the Greater Buffalo (New York) Youth Orchestra; several band works were commissioned by U.S. service bands. There have been many recordings.

He wrote Concerto for 23 Winds at the age of thirty in 1957.

733036,Pelle og Proffen,Introduction,"


'''''Pelle og Proffen''''' is Norwegian writer Ingvar Ambjørnsen's youth series about Pelle and Proffen two fictional detective teenage boys from Oslo getting involved in all kinds of crimes or mysteries involving such things as drugs pollution and Nazism usually in the Oslo area but also elsewhere in Norway. They are very similar to Franklin Dixon's Hardy Boys. The stories are told by Pelle who lives in an apartment in Torshov Oslo with his parents. Proffen lives with his parents in the apartment below so the boys can reach each other through Pelle's floor and Proffen's roof.

Together they try to solve the mysteries they get into. Proffen is the smarter one. One of his interests is reading good detective books. His brother is a journalist from the Norwegian newspaper ''Dagbladet'' who tries to help the boys as well as he can by supplying them with unofficial information he got from ''Dagbladet''.

The books ''Døden på Oslo S'' ''Giftige Løgner'' and ''De Blå Ulvene'' were turned into successful movies. ''Døden på Oslo S'' became particularly well known for the way it dealt with Oslo underground life.

27127,Visual binary,Determining stellar masses,"Binary systems are particularly important here because they are orbiting each other their gravitational interaction can be studied by observing parameters of their orbit around each other and the centre of mass. Before applying Kepler's 3rd Law the inclination of the orbit of the visual binary must be taken into account. Relative to an observer on Earth the orbital plane will usually be tilted. If it is at 0° the planes will be seen to coincide and if at 90° they will be seen edge on. Due to this inclination the elliptical true orbit will project an elliptical apparent orbit onto the plane of the sky. Kepler's 3rd law still holds but with a constant of proportionality that changes with respect to the elliptical apparent orbit.
The inclination of the orbit can be determined by measuring the separation between the primary star and the apparent focus. Once this information is known the true eccentricity and the true semi-major axis can be calculated since the apparent orbit will be shorter than the true orbit assuming an inclination greater than 0° and this effect can be corrected for using simple geometry

:

Where  is the true semi-major axis and  is the parallax.

Once the true orbit is known Kepler's 3rd law can be applied. We re-write it in terms of the observable quantities such that

:

From this equation we obtain the sum of the masses involved in the binary system. Remembering a previous equation we derived

:

where

:

we can solve the ratio of the semi-major axis and therefore a ratio for the two masses since

:

and

:

The individual masses of the stars follow from these ratios and knowing the separation between each star and the centre of mass of the system.
"
227445,Victorio Edades,Artistic development,"
Early styles after his stint in architecture already show his inclination towards modernist technique. In The Market and The Picnic his choice of subject matter do not take flight from pleasant daily scenery; yet his brush strokes and observance of non-proportionality in the figures made his teachers consider him ""very ambitious."" His earlier works already showed his affinity towards the style of Cézanne and other Post-Impressionists.

The height of his artistic development is his dynamic entry into Philippine art in 1928 with his solo exhibit at the Philippine Columbia Club. Here he mounted his most renowned work The Builders. This work is the sum total of all the other pieces included in the show. They are a far cry from the works of the first Philippine national artist and most popular painter Fernando Amorsolo and the other classicists who painted bright cheery scenes of flawless Filipinos and their idealized daily routines. Edades on the other hand presented figures in muddy earth colors – yellow ochres and raw sienna accented by bold black contours. Subjects are distorted figures (those whose proportions defy classical measure) and Edades’ brush strokes are agitated and harsh. The choice of his subject also caused quite a stir to those who viewed the show. He portrayed tough dirty construction laborers and simple folk wrestling in dung and dust. Even his nudes are nothing like Amorsolo's portrayal of the Filipina at her best.

With the uproar Edades' ideas raised he knew that he cannot make a living out by merely painting what he wished. So he got by producing commissioned works particularly murals. He did murals for prominent individuals (like Juan Nakpil) and institutions.
His later works are said to be ‘flatter.’ His portraits and genre paintings in Davao are not seen to be as heavy or solid as his earlier phase with The Builders. From Cézanne Edades grew more interested in the style of Utamaro of Japan and other artists whose charm is in color rather than solidity.

By introducing modern ideas into the Philippine art scene Victorio Edades managed to destroy the conventions of domestic art and also got rid of the clichéd ideology he believed stunted the development of Philippine art. His defiance to what the Conservatives structured as ‘art’ was a conscious call for real artistic expression. He attested that ""art is ever the expression of man's emotion and not a mere photographic likeness of nature. Thus to express his individual emotion the artist is privileged to create in that distinctive form that best interprets his own experience. And the distortion of plastic elements of art such as line mass and color – is one of the many ways of expressing one's rhythmic form."" That was the reason why his disproportionate figures are made that way – for the sake of composition.

Through his continuous propagation of modern art as shown in his works and teachings Edades proved that modernists were not fooling people as Guillermo Tolentino asserted. Dialectic-ally Edades explained that Modern Art is not anti-Classicist. He said ""From the technical point of view Modern Art is an outgrowth of Classical Art. Modern Art is the interpretation of the Classical concept conditioned by the artist's new experience with the aid of improved means of aesthetic expression."" Not conforming to the academic perception of art he made art available to the common man. Through his determination to stand by his ideology he became a bridge between the past and the present.

497827,Victoria Drummond,Apprenticeship,"In 1915 Drummond turned 21 and her father encouraged her to choose her own career. She repeated her ambition to be a marine engineer. From 18 October 1916 she was apprenticed at the Northern Garage South Street Perth. Her wage as a first year apprentice was three shillings a week from which sixpence was deducted for National Insurance so her net wage was half a crown. In her second year her wage before National Insurance was six shillings. Her foreman a Mr Malcolm who had worked in Clyde shipyards gone to sea and risen to be a Chief Engineer at sea supported her training. On three evenings a week a teacher from Dundee Technical College now Abertay University taught her maths and engineering.

Mr Malcolm supported Drummond's training but in 1918 the garage dismissed him for drunkenness. Drummond took this as the right time to move on and resigned from the garage. Her father got her an introduction to the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company in Dundee which took her on in its engine and boiler works at Lilybank in Dundee. She started as a pattern maker for metal casting and in 1919 was promoted to the finishing shop. She completed her apprenticeship in 1920 and stayed on at Caledon as a journeyman later transferring to the drawing office. In 1922 Caledon suffered a decline in orders and laid off many workers including Drummond who left on 7 July.

The Steelyard possibly gave its name to the steelyard balance a type of portable balance consisting of a suspended horizontal beam. An object to be weighed would be hung on the shorter end of the beam while weights would be slid along the longer end till the beam balanced.  The weight could then be calculated by multiplying the sum of the known weights by the ratio of the distances from the beam's fulcrum.

440428,Nick Bottom,Analysis,"Bottom's discussion of his dream is considered by Ann Thompson to have emulated two passages from Chaucer's ''The Book of the Duchess''.

Critics have commented on the profound religious implications of Bottom's speech on his awakening without the ass's head in act 4 of A Midsummer Night's Dream:

"". . . The eye of 
man hath not heard the ear of man hath not seen
man's hand is not able to taste his tongue to conceive
nor his heart to report what my dream was. I
will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this
dream: it shall be called 'Bottom's Dream' because
it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the latter end
of a play before the Duke. Peradventure to make it the
more gracious I shall sing it at her death."" (4.1.209–216)

This speech seems to be a comically jumbled evocation of a passage from the New Testament's 1 Corinthians 2.9–10:

""The things which
eye hathe not sene nether eare hath heard
nether came into man's heart are which
God hathe prepared for them that love him.
But God hathe reveiled them unto us by
his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all
things yea the deepe things of God.""


Steven Doloff also suggests that Bottom's humorous and foolish performance at the end of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" mimics a passage from the previous chapter of Corinthians:

""For seing the worlde by wisdome knewe
not God in the wisdome of God it pleased
God by the foolishnes of preaching
to save them that believe:
Seing also that the Jewes require a signe
and the Grecians seke after wisdome.
But we preache Christ crucified : unto
the Jewes even a stombling blocke & unto
the Grecians foolishnes:
But unto them which are called bothe
of the Jewes & Grecias we preache Christ
the power of GOD and the wisdome of
God.
For the foolishnes of God is wiser the
men . . .."" (1 Corinthians 1.21–25)


This passage's description of the skeptical reception Christ was given by his Greek audience appears to be alluded to in Bottom's performance. Just as Christ's preaching is regarded as ""foolishnes"" Bottom's audience perceives his acting (as well as the entirety of the play he is a part of) as completely without value except for the humor they can find in the actors' hopelessly flawed rendering of their subject matter. Doloff writes that this allusion is especially likely because in both texts the skeptical audience of the ""foolish"" material is composed of Greeks as the spectators of Bottom et al. are Theseus the duke of Athens and his court.

228823,Citroën Xantia,History,"The Xantia replaced the earlier Citroën BX (which straddled both small and large family car segments) and maintained the high level of popularity of that model but brought the car more into the mainstream to compete harder with its rivals such as the Ford Mondeo Nissan Primera Rover 600 Toyota Carina E and Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier. The car was built from November 1992 to October 2002 in France totalling almost ten years including the facelift in December 1997.

It signalled that Citroën had learned from the reception given to the staid Citroën ZX introduced two years earlier and criticised by contemporary journalists for its lack of traditional Citroën flair in engineering and design. Citroën addressed these concerns in the Xantia.

The Xantia also used the traditional Citroën hydropneumatic suspension system which was pioneered by the older DS. It was initially only available as a hatchback (notchback) (Berline) but an estate (station wagon) (Break) version built by Heuliez appeared in September 1995.

Inline with PSA Group policy the Peugeot 406 launched two years later used the same floorpan core structure and engines as the Xantia. The Hydractive suspension system was not carried over and the 406 utilised a more traditional spring suspension.

Sales in the United Kingdom were strong and even though it was never able to match the volume of British favourites such as the Ford Mondeo or Vauxhall Vectra the car did help Citroën establish a strong foothold in the business car market in the United Kingdom.

On September 7 2006 archaeologists in Ukraine announced that an ancient structure had been discovered near Luhansk which the press reported as a pyramid antedating those in Egypt by at least 300 years. The stone foundations of the structure were said to resemble Aztec and Mayan pyramids in Mesoamerica. It was later concluded that the site in question was not a pyramid but was still of great interest.

70682,Max North Dakota,History,"
Before 1906 rumors were circulating that the Soo Line would lay track close to Elbow Lake north of Garrison to obtain water for their steam engines. On this prospect enterprising businessmen swiftly began staking claims in anticipation of purchasing prime real estate in a new town. A haphazard shack-building boom ensued on the surrounding ambling prairies. On August 8 1906 a surveyor named J.G. Sheldrick filed a certificate to plat what would become the Max townsite on a grid.

The Soo Line came from the south and would have east and west branches at a junction to be named ""Junction"" or ""Junction City"". However people started calling it Max's Post Office after Max Freitag eldest son of Paul Freitag. Paul Freitag was a local farmer and the first postmaster. Max asked people he met at the junction if they were coming to ''""his""'' post office to pick up their mail. The name truncated to simply Max stuck (in habit if not officially). When the town was later moved two miles west to the present townsite the name was changed officially to Max.

The Central Light and Power Company installed street lights in January 1918.

In 1947 Max decided to fully incorporate with affairs managed by an elected mayor and aldermanic council of four.

In the early 1950s the town obtained a new telephone system updated fire equipment waterworks water mains and a sewerage system.

365175,Fokker E.II,Design and development,"Eastern Front.
On 13 June 1915 Anthony Fokker demonstrated the first E.II to an audience of German commanders including Crown Prince Wilhelm of Germany at a German Fifth Army airfield. On 23 and 24 June he demonstrated the aircraft at Douai to the German Sixth Army. It was during these demonstrations only one week before any kills would be achieved in the ''Eindecker'' type that Fokker himself attempted to engage an enemy aircraft but he was unable to find a target.

The major difference between the types was a reduced wingspan on the E.II intended to increase speed but handling and climbing performance suffered. The type was therefore quickly superseded by the E.III. The E.II also had a larger fuel capacity of 90 litres (23.75 US gallons) to supply the Oberursel U.I's 54 litres/hour fuel consumption as compared to the E.I's 69 litres (18.2 US gallons) capacity to feed its earlier U.0 rotary which used 37 litres/hour of fuel. As with the M.5K/MG quintet of production prototype Eindeckers the pilot was provided with a head support to help him resist the airstream when he had to raise his head to use the gun sights.

Max Immelmann's Fokker E.II in late October 1915 showing the initial form of soffit surface that the larger Oberursel U.I nine-cylinder rotary engine and larger diameter cowl required.
The heavier weight of the 75 kW (100 hp) Oberursel U.I rotary engine used to power the E.II necessitated both a somewhat lengthened rear fuselage structure in comparison to the E.I version to achieve proper balance with the U.I engine's larger diameter requiring a larger radius ""horseshoe"" pattern cowl to enclose it and the aluminum upper deck of the nose was raised along with it - resulting in metal soffits having to be fitted where the upper deck met the upper longerons with additional structural metal tubing additions to the forward ends of the upper longerons immediately behind the firewall to support the ""soffits"" and sides of the raised upper nose panel. This format was continued with the E.III.

The E.II was built in parallel with the E.I and the choice of whether an airframe became an E.I or E.II depended on the availability of engines. In total Fokker production figures state that 49 E.IIs were built and 45 of these had been delivered to the Western Front ''Fliegertruppe'' by December 1915 (Luftstreitkräfte from October 1916 onwards) at which time production switched to the main ''Eindecker'' variant the Fokker E.III which used the same 75 kW (100 hp) Oberursel U.I engine. Some E.IIs under production were completed as E.IIIs and numerous E.IIs returned to Fokker's factory for repair were upgraded to E.III specification.

500938,Heilmann & Littmann,Introduction,"
'''Heilmann & Littmann''' was a leading German contracting business.

It was founded in 1871 by Jakob Heilmann (1846-1927) in Regensburg as ""Baugeschäft J. Heilmann"" (J. Heilmann building company) and by 1876 specialized on railway construction later on in building construction.

In 1892 the architect Max Littmann (1862-1931) Heilmann's son-in-law joined the company thus forming an ordinary partnership (""Offene Handelsgesellschaft Heilmann & Littmann""). 

In 1897 Richard Reverdy became another partner and managing director and the company was transformed into a limited liability company specialising on the construction of theaters and other monumental structure e.g. the present-day Munich Hofbräuhaus was erected during the years 1896 and 1897 by Heilmann & Littmann.

After Jakob Heilmann's death in 1927 the construction businesses in Munich Nuremberg and Berlin were taken over by the ''Heilmann'sche Immobilien-Gesellschaft AG'' creating the '''Heilmann & Littmann Bau-AG'''. 
After a merger in 1980 with the '''Sager & Woerner KG''' the company's name changed into '''Heilit + Woerner Bau-AG''' and eventually it was taken over by the ''Walter Bau AG'' Augsburg.

491257,Stockton South (UK Parliament constituency),History,"The seat was formed from a combination of Stockton-on-Tees and Thornaby in 1983 predominantly as a replacement to the latter seat.

;Political history
More ""middle-class"" than neighbouring Stockton North and first held by the former SDP-Liberal Alliance very narrowly in 1983 then by a Conservative from 1987 for the next ten years the seat acted as a bellwether in Labour's landslide in 1997 and its member Dari Taylor retained until the 2010 general election when the Conservative James Wharton narrowly won the seat.  It was the Conservative Party's only gain in the North East with Wharton substantially increasing his majority in the 2015 general election. But Labour's victory in the seat in  2017 saw the seat's 30 year status as a bellwether constituency come to an end.

General Chemical Structure of an ortho- (or mono-) phosph'''a'''te ester. Here any R can be H or some other organic radical

The -OH groups in phosphoric acids can also condense with the hydroxyl groups of alcohols to form phosphate esters.  Since orthophosphoric acid has three -OH groups it can esterify with one two or three alcohol molecules to form a mono- di- or triester.  See the general structure image of an ortho- (or mono-) phosphate ester below on the left where any of the '''R''' groups can be a hydrogen or an organic radical.  Pyro- (or di-) phosphate esters and tripoly- (or tri-) phosphate esters etc. are also possible.  Any -OH groups on the phosphates in these ester molecules may lose H+ ions to form anions again depending on the pH in a solution.  In the biochemistry of living organisms there are many kinds of (mono)phosphate diphosphate and triphosphate compounds (essentially esters) many of which play a significant role in metabolism such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and triphosphate (ATP).

Vasmath has an average literacy rate of 65% higher than the national average of 59.5%; with 58% of the males and 42% of females literate. 16% of the population is under 6 years of age.

There are 3 degree colleges – Bahirji Smarak Mahavidylaya Vasmath and Yoganand Mahavidylaya and Raosaheb Patange arts college.
Also along with many near by site seeings. Schools like Sarswati Vidya Niketan Mahatma Gandhi Vidhyalaya are welknown in the town.There is small village named Shivpuri at 3–4 km distance from Vasmath Bus Station which is famous for its 100+ years old Balaji Temple

Vasmath is the only tehsil in Hingoli district which is well irrigated and having well agricultural land.
  
Vasmath has a cosmopolitan culture as five major communities (Hindu Muslim Buddhist Sikh and Jain) have resident in the city it reflects the real culture of the India where people live together with great happiness though they are from different culture state language community. There are many industries in the city specially Purna Global Textile Industry this industry is making inner wears for big companies like Rupa VIP etc. And  Gajanana Warehousing Gajanana Food Processing which are known for its quality and performance. This Industry is also having its own JUST FEEL Brand of inner wears.

The area of the Vasmath city is fully surrounded by green agricultural opportunity. Due to non availability of manforce many things are not able to grow
 
Hingoli district is classified as a ""No Industry Zone"" and hence a culture of industrialisation has not developed nor the government of Maharashtra has taken any interest to develop the region. Despite this fact there is plenty of industries operating in areas such as   Biofuel Sugar Cane and Cotton.

223510,Supermarine Walrus,Development,"Supermarine Walrus I serial number K5783 from the first production batch. Photo taken between 1937 and 1939.

The Walrus was initially developed as a private venture in response to a 1929 Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) requirement for an aircraft to be catapult-launched from cruisers and was originally called the '''Seagull V''' although it only resembled the earlier Supermarine Seagull III in general layout.  Construction was started in 1930 but owing to Supermarine's other commitments it was not completed until 1933.
 
The single-step hull was constructed from aluminium alloy with stainless-steel forgings for the catapult spools and mountings.  Metal construction was used because experience had shown that wooden structures deteriorated rapidly under tropical conditions.  The wings which were slightly swept back had stainless–steel spars and wooden ribs and were covered in fabric. The lower wings were set in the shoulder position with a stabilising float mounted under each one. The horizontal tail-surfaces were positioned high on the tail-fin and braced on either side by N struts. The wings could be folded on ship giving a stowage width of . The single  Pegasus II M2  radial engine was housed at the rear of a nacelle mounted on four struts above the lower wing and braced by four shorter struts to the centre-section of the upper wing. This powered a four-bladed wooden propeller in pusher configuration. The engine nacelle contained the oil tank arranged around the air intake at the front of the nacelle to act as an oil cooler and electrical equipment and had a number of access panels for maintenance. A supplementary oil cooler was mounted on the starboard side. Fuel was carried in two tanks in the upper wings. The pusher configuration had the advantages of keeping the engine and propeller further out of the way of spray when operating on water and reducing the noise level inside the aircraft. Also the moving propeller was safely away from any crew standing on the front deck which would be done when picking up a mooring line.   The engine was offset by three degrees to starboard to counter any tendency of the aircraft to yaw due to  unequal forces on the rudder caused by the vortex from the propeller.

A solid aluminium tailwheel was enclosed within a small water-rudder which could be coupled to the main rudder for taxiing or disengaged for takeoff and landing.

Although the aircraft typically flew with one pilot there were positions for two. The left-hand position was the main one with the instrument panel and a fixed seat while the right-hand seat could be folded away to allow access to the nose gun-position via a crawl-way. An unusual feature was that the control column was not a fixed fitting in the usual way but could be unplugged from either of two sockets at floor level. It became a habit for only one column to be in use; and when control was passed from the pilot to co-pilot or vice versa the control column would simply be unplugged and handed over. Behind the cockpit there was a small cabin with work stations for the navigator and radio operator.

Armament usually consisted of two .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers K machine guns one in each of the open positions in the nose and rear fuselage; with provision for carrying bombs or depth charges mounted beneath the lower wings. Like other flying boats the Walrus carried marine equipment for use on the water including an anchor towing and mooring cables drogues and a boat-hook.

The prototype was first flown by ""Mutt"" Summers on 21 June 1933; five days later it made an appearance  at the SBAC show at Hendon where Summers startled the spectators (R. J. Mitchell among them) by looping the aircraft.  Such aerobatics were possible because the aircraft had been stressed for catapult launching.  On 29 July Supermarine handed the aircraft over to the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment at Felixstowe.  Over the following months extensive trials were carried out including shipborne trials aboard ''Repulse'' and ''Valiant'' carried out on behalf of the Royal Australian Navy and catapult trials carried out by the Royal Aircraft Establishment at  Farnborough becoming the first amphibious aircraft in the world to be launched by catapult with a full military load piloted by Flight Lieutenant Sydney Richard Ubee.
     
The strength of the aircraft was demonstrated in 1935 when the prototype was attached to the battleship ''Nelson'' at Portland. With the commander-in-chief of the Home Fleet Admiral Roger Backhouse on board the pilot attempted a water touch-down forgetting that the undercarriage was in the down position. The Walrus was immediately flipped over but the occupants only had minor injuries; the machine was later repaired and returned to service. Soon afterwards the Walrus became one of the first aircraft to be fitted with an undercarriage position indicator on the instrument panel. Test pilot Alex Henshaw later stated that the Walrus was strong enough to make a wheels-up landing on grass without much damage (he also commented that it was ""the noisiest coldest and most uncomfortable"" aircraft he had ever flown).

When flying from a warship the Walrus would be recovered by touching-down alongside then lifted from the sea by a ship's crane. The aircraft's lifting-gear was kept in a compartment in the section of wing directly above the engine – one of the Walrus' crew would climb onto the top wing and attach this to the crane hook. Landing and recovery was a straightforward procedure in calm waters but could be very difficult if the conditions were rough.  The usual procedure was for the parent ship to turn through around 20° just before the aircraft touched down thus creating a 'slick' to the lee side of ship on which the Walrus could alight this being followed by a fast taxi up to the ship before the 'slick' dissipated.

The RAAF ordered 24 examples of the Seagull V in 1933 these being delivered from 1935.  These aircraft differed from the prototype and the aircraft flown by the RAF in having Handley-Page slots fitted to the upper wings. This was followed by the first order for 12 aircraft from the RAF placed in May 1935  with the first production aircraft serial number ''K5772'' flying on 16 March 1936.  In RAF service the type was named the Walrus.  Initial production aircraft were powered by the Pegasus II M2: from 1937  the  Pegasus VI was fitted.

Production aircraft differed in minor details from the prototype.  The transition between the upper decking and the aircraft sides was rounded off the three struts bracing the tailplane were reduced to two and the trailing edges of the lower wing were hinged to fold 90° upwards rather than 180° downwards when the wings were folded and the external oil cooler was omitted.

A total of 740 Walruses were built in three major variants: the '''Seagull V''' '''Walrus I''' and the '''Walrus II'''. The Mark IIs were all constructed by Saunders-Roe and the prototype first flew in May 1940. This aircraft had a wooden hull which was heavier but had the advantage of using less of the precious wartime stockpiles of light metal alloys. Saunders-Roe would go on to build under license 270 metal Mark Is and 191 wooden-hulled Mark IIs.

The successor to the Walrus was the Supermarine Sea Otter – a similar but more powerful design. Sea Otters never completely replaced the Walruses and served alongside them in the air-sea rescue role during the latter part of the war. A post-war replacement for both aircraft the Supermarine Seagull was cancelled in 1952 with only prototypes being constructed. By that time helicopters were taking over from small flying-boats in the air-sea rescue role.

The Walrus was known as the ""Shagbat"" or sometimes ""Steam-pigeon""; the latter name coming from the steam produced by water striking the hot Pegasus engine.

614861,Beaumont Hotel (Ouray Colorado),History,"The Ouray Real Estate and Building Association started construction on the Beaumont Hotel on 5 July 1886 completing it on 15 December 1886 at a cost of $75000.  Palmer House supplied employees for the grand opening on 25 July 1887.  All of the original furniture was made by Marshall Field's.

The Beaumont  was one of the first hotels in the country to be wired for alternating current electricity.  It boasted guests such as Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover.  The hotel closed in 1964 due to declining tourism in the area.  For over 30 years the hotel sat empty boarded up and in disrepair.  At one point part of the roof collapsed and more than once the building was considered for condemnation.  The hotel was sold in 1998 and was meticulously restored its multiple rooms combined into a more spacious arrangement — the large hotel building now has just 12 guest rooms.  It reopened in 2003 and received the Governor's Award for Historic Preservation. In 2004 it received one of the first four Preserve America Presidential Awards for historic preservation.

749981,1953 Pacific typhoon season,Introduction,"

The '''1953 Pacific typhoon season''' has no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1954 but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between June and December. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean.

The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean north of the equator and west of the international date line. Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 1953 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical Storms formed in the entire west Pacific basin were assigned a name by the Fleet Weather Center on Guam.

690458,Royal Observatory Edinburgh,Present day,"=== Telescopes ===
The original 1894 building includes two cylindrical copper domes on top of the East and West Towers. These were refurbished in 2010. The East Dome still shelters a 36-inch (0.9 m) Cassegrain reflector that was installed in 1930. This is part of the visitor centre exhibition but is not operational any more. A 16/24-inch (0.4/0.6 m) Schmidt camera was installed in the West Dome in 1951. In 2010 this was removed to the National Museum of Scotland. The only working telescope is a Meade MAX 20in ACF (0.5 m) reflector in a hemispherical dome on top of the teaching laboratories. This telescope is used for undergraduate teaching. As of April 2012 the 1967 telescope and mount have been removed to Mid-Kent Astronomical Society; a replacement telescope will be installed later in 2012.

164788,Wishful thinking,Attention,"
Humans have a physiologically limited visual field that must be selectively directed to certain stimuli. Attention is the cognitive process that allows this task to be accomplished and it might be responsible for the phenomenon of wishful seeing. Expectations desires and fears are among the various factors that help direct attention.   Consequently these cognitive experiences have the opportunity to influence the perceptual experience. In turn attention can organize planned movement providing a mechanism through which visual stimuli can influence behavior.

Attentional deficits can also lead to altered perceptual experiences. Inattentional blindness where unexpected events go by undetected is one such deficit. Using an inattentional blindness paradigm researchers White and Davies had participants fixate on a cross in the center of the screen. First a number cue denoting the number of letters that would appear on the arms of the cross appeared in the center of the cross. Following the cue the actual letters would appear on the arms of the cross. Over four trials the number of letters matched the number that was cued. On the fifth trial half of the participants were cued to expect a smaller number of letters and half were cued to expect the correct number of letters. The letters then appeared on the screen accompanied by an unexpected stimulus. Participants were asked which letters appeared and whether they had seen any additional object. Participants cued to expect fewer letters were more susceptible to inattentional blindness as they failed to detect the unexpected stimulus more often than participants who had been cued to expect the correct number of stimuli. These results indicate that attentional capacity is affected by expectations. This provides further evidence that cognitive processes converge in order to help construct the perceptual experience.

Although attention can lead to enhanced perceptual processing the lack of attention to stimuli can also lead to a perceived enhanced perception of the stimuli. Participants were pre-cued that indicated the diagonal to which they should be attending. They were then presented with stimuli (gratings with different textures) and then a response cue that indicated the diagonal for which the participants had to judge their perception. 70% of the time the response cue matched the pre-cue and 30% of the time did not match the pre-cue. The participants were asked to report texture of the gratings that appeared in the response-cue and discriminate its visibility. This set-up allowed them to compare the perception of attended (cued) and non-attended stimuli (uncued).  Higher visibility was reported for stimuli that was unattended. Therefore inattention lead to an overestimation of perception sensitivity. This study suggests attention bias a mechanism of wishful thinking does not only rely on what individuals fixate upon but the unattended stimuli as well.

===Interpretation of emotion===
Emotion is often interpreted through visual cues on the face body language and context.  However context and cultural backgrounds have been shown to influence the visual perception and interpretation of emotion. Cross-cultural differences in change blindness have been associated with perceptual set or a tendency to attend to visual scenes in a particular way. For example eastern cultures tend to emphasize background of an object while western cultures focus on central objects in a scene. Perceptual sets are also the result of cultural aesthetic preferences. Therefore cultural context can influence how people sample information from a face just like they would do in a situational context. For example Caucasians generally fixate around eyes nose and mouth while Asians fixate on eyes. Individuals from different cultural backgrounds who were shown a series of faces and asked to sort them into piles in which every face showed the same emotion. Fixation on different features of the face leads to disparate reading of emotions.  Asians' focus on the eyes lead to the perception of startled faces as surprise rather than fear.  As a result previous associations or customs of an individual can lead to different categorization or recognition of emotion. This particular difference in visual perception of emotion seems to suggest an attention bias mechanism for wishful seeing since certain visual cues were attended to (e.g. nose eyes) and the others were ignored (e.g. mouth).

===Optimism===
Wishful seeing is also linked to optimism bias through which individuals tend to expect positive outcomes from events despite such expectations having little basis in reality. In order to determine the neural correlates underlying optimism bias one functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study imaged the brains of individuals as they recalled autobiographical moments related to life events and then rated their memories on several scales. These ratings revealed that participants viewed future positive events as more positive than past positive events and negative events as more temporally distant. The active brain regions compared to a fixation point were the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and the right amygdala. Both of these areas became less active when imagining negative future events. The rACC is implicated in assessing emotional content and has strong connections to the amygdala. It is suggested that the rACC regulates activation in brain regions associated with emotion and autobiographical memory thus allowing for the projection of positivity onto images of future events.

It is important to consider physical aspects such as eye movement and brain activity and their relationship to wishful thinking wishful seeing and optimism. Isaacowitz (2006) investigated the motivational role of gaze which he claims is highly correlated to an individual's interests and personality. In his study participants who embodied varying levels of self-reported optimism were directed to look at images of skin cancer line drawings that were similar to the cancer pictures and neutral faces. Using a remote eye tracking system that measured the movement of the participants gaze Isaacowitz found that more optimistically minded young adults gazed less on the skin cancer images when compared to the less optimistically minded participants. This data was replicated in a follow up study in which participants were screened for their genetically based risk for contracting skin cancer (even though some participants were more at risk than others higher levels of optimism were correlated with a less fixated gaze on the skin cancer images despite the fact that the images were relevant to some participants).

488629,My Favorite Things (album),Music,"Released a mere month after ''Coltrane Jazz'' unlike his first two albums for Atlantic this one contains no original compositions instead jazz versions of four pop standards. The album was also the first to quite clearly mark Coltrane's change from bebop to modal jazz which was slowly becoming apparent in some of his previous releases. The famous track is a modal rendition of the Rodgers and Hammerstein song ""My Favorite Things"" from ''The Sound of Music''. The melody is heard numerous times throughout but instead of playing solos over the written chord changes both Tyner and Coltrane take extended solos over vamps of the two tonic chords E minor and E major played in waltz time. In the documentary ''The World According to John Coltrane'' narrator Ed Wheeler remarks on the impact that this song's popularity had on Coltrane's career:
In 1960 Coltrane left Miles Davis and formed his own quartet to further explore modal playing freer directions and a growing Indian influence. They transformed ""My Favorite Things"" the cheerful populist song from 'The Sound of Music' into a hypnotic eastern dervish dance. The recording was a hit and became Coltrane's most requested tune—and a bridge to broad public acceptance.

The standard ""Summertime"" is notable for its upbeat searching feel a demonstration of Coltrane's ""sheets of sound"" a stark antithesis to Miles Davis' melancholy lyrical version on ''Porgy and Bess'' and makes use of offbeat pedal points and augmented chords. ""But Not For Me"" is reharmonised using the famous Coltrane changes and features an extended coda over a repeated ii-V-I-vi progression.

On March 3 1998 Rhino Records reissued ''My Favorite Things'' as part of its Atlantic 50th Anniversary Jazz Gallery series. Included as bonus tracks were both sides of the ""My Favorite Things"" single released as Atlantic 5012 in 1961.

654334,Taoist Tai Chi,Foundation exercises,"In addition to the full 108 Taoist Tai Chi set students are taught a unique group of cyclical foundation exercises that focus on the joints called ""the jongs"". Most of these exercises either in their form or execution are completely unique to Taoist Tai Chi. These exercises are not only used as preliminaries to the form they are espoused as being the basic elements that provide health benefit in the varying movements of Taoist Tai Chi. Instructors often explain postures by referring to a foundation exercise. The 108 forms shown below were originally developed by Yang Chengfu published in 1931 and 1934 and are commonly referred to as traditional Yang Style Tai Chi Chuan.

The main foundations include:
* A basic forearm rotation: the forearms are held up and forward and rotate in and out. The hands are located in front of the left and right meridian. The elbows are stationary.
* A rotation of the arms in front of the body: making a circular motion with the hands: where one pushes away the other pulls in. The thumbs move from the central axis of  the body.  It is mainly an upper body stretch in which the arms move outward from the center and then back.
* ''Dan Yu'' (spine stretching). A squatting exercise meant to work primarily the pelvic region the legs and the lower back. Fifty or more repetitions may be performed in advanced classes. The feet are placed in a stance wider than the shoulders. When squatting the knees move in the direction of the feet.
* ''Tor Yu'' (spine turning). The feet are at the typical ""Straight/45"" position minding the ""in-stepping/out-stepping"". The pelvis alternates between weight over the front ""Straight"" and the back ""45"" foot. Thus the trunk moves following the pelvis. The hands follow the body and cross in front of the lower dantian when the body moves backward to the '45 back"" position and then uncross and push away towards the ""Straight front"" position leading the trunk. For the outside observer it seems that the hands make a circular motion however they don't for the practitioner. In addition to its purported health benefits this exercise is particularly similar to the Silk reeling of other styles in that it helps develop the theory of movement present in all of Taoist Tai Chi.
* An arm separation such as in kicks: the arms start crossed in front of the body move sideways backward and down and forward up again with the hands crossed on the centerline in front of the chest.
* A variant of the ''Wave Hands like Clouds'' move.
* Stationary stance versions of the posture ""Snake Creeps Low"" in which the practitioner may come to a full standing position in between left and right sides of the posture.
* Sometimes repetitions of various other movements (e.g. Brush Knee Go Back to Ward Off Monkey or Flying at a Slant) but usually movements that lend themselves to repetition.

372110,Arthur Numan,Club career,"
===Early career===
He started his career with the amateur club SV Beverwijk and was spotted by Haarlem who handed him his first professional game against DS '79 on 26 March 1988 which his team won 2–0. He originally played in a more attacking role but his long-time mentor Dick Advocaat then the coach of Haarlem positioned him as a left fullback.

===PSV Eindhoven===
Numan joined Twente at the close of the 1990–91 season where he has scored goals even as a defender. He was named team captain for the Enschede team and also captained the Dutch Under 21 national team. However it was not until he joined PSV Eindhoven that his talents were fully appreciated. He was drafted into the Dutch team for a World Cup qualifying game against Poland which ended in a 2–2 draw on 14 October 1992. Numan was substituted after forty minutes by Advocaat who was then the national team coach and brought on PSV teammate Gerald Vanenburg as his team was 2–0 down early in the game.

===Rangers===
A £4.5 million deal took him to Rangers in May 1998 but Numan's time in Scotland was then blighted by injuries that forced him to sit out many games. Dick Advocaat who managed the team at that time waited for Numan to recover a move which was rewarded when he helped the team to considerable league success as well as the treble in his penultimate season at Rangers. Numan was awarded the teams vice-captaincy serving as deputy to captain Lorenzo Amoruso. He had a particularly prolific relationship with German international left sided midfielder Jorg Albertz. However at the end of the 2002–03 season he and the club could not agree a new contract so he left at the end of that season. He stated that he was willing to accept a pay-cut offer but felt that his club wanted too large a drop in wages. He soon announced his retirement. A late offer by Villarreal failed to change his mind and he refused to continue his career in Holland. He was not looking forward to start afresh training and playing hectic games every week. After Rangers Numan still finds the time in between his other duties to attend games at Ibrox and can be seen mixing with fans and making appearances at Rangers bars in Glasgow singing Karaoke.

10171,MusicBrainz,Fingerprinting,"Besides collecting metadata about music MusicBrainz also allows looking up recordings by their acoustic fingerprint. A separate application such as MusicBrainz Picard must be used for this.

=== Proprietary services ===
In 2000 MusicBrainz started using Relatable's patented TRM (a recursive acronym for TRM Recognizes Music) for acoustic fingerprint matching. This feature attracted many users and allowed the database to grow quickly. However by 2005 TRM was showing scalability issues as the number of tracks in the database had reached into the millions. This issue was resolved in May 2006 when MusicBrainz partnered with MusicIP (now AmpliFIND) replacing TRM with MusicDNS. TRMs were phased out and replaced by MusicDNS in November 2008.

=== AcoustID and Chromaprint ===
In October 2009 MusicIP was acquired by AmpliFIND. Some time after the acquisition the MusicDNS service began having intermittent problems. Since the future of the free identification service was uncertain a replacement for it was sought. The Chromaprint acoustic fingerprinting algorithm the basis for AcoustID identification service was started in February 2010 by a long-time MusicBrainz contributor Lukáš Lalinský. While AcoustID and Chromaprint are not officially MusicBrainz projects they are closely tied with each other and both are open source. Chromaprint works by analyzing the first two minutes of a track detecting the strength in each of 12 pitch classes storing these 8 times per second. Additional post-processing is then applied to compress this fingerprint while retaining patterns. The AcoustID search server then searches from the database of fingerprints by similarity and returns the AcoustID identifier along with MusicBrainz recording identifiers if known.

179290,Downer (animal),Introduction,"

A '''downer''' is an animal usually livestock that cannot stand on its own and therefore is to be killed.  A '''downed''' animal one that is unable to stand is not necessarily a downer.

The animal's inability to stand may be caused by illness or injury. In nearly all cases it is considered by most farmers to be both humane and cost-effective to kill the animal when it becomes a downer rather than keeping it alive and unhealthy. Once killed and depending on how the animal became a downer and how it was killed the animal may then be incinerated buried rendered or slaughtered.  Because of mad cow disease the slaughter of downer cattle is a topic of great concern.

There are many possible reasons for an animal staying down including:
*Mastitis
*Metritis
*Hypomagnesaemia
*Hypocalcaemia
*Ketosis
*Dystocia
**Nerve damage
**Pelvic fracture
*Long bone fracture
*Neurological disease

365694,G. Mennen Williams,Governor of Michigan,"Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion in Tel Aviv October 1 1959
On November 2 1948 Williams was elected Governor of Michigan defeating Governor Kim Sigler with the support of labor unions and dissident Republicans. He was subsequently elected to a record six two-year terms in that post. Among his accomplishments was the construction of the Mackinac Bridge. He appeared on the cover of ''Time'''s September 15 1952 issue sporting his signature green bow tie with white polka dots.

Williams believed the Michigan Department of Corrections was underfunded and outdated and that the state's prisons were dangerously overcrowded. While visiting Marquette Branch Prison in July 1950 Williams was attacked and briefly held hostage by a group of three inmates hoping to escape. The governor had a knife held to his throat but his attackers were soon overpowered by his bodyguard and prison employees. One of his attackers was shot dead. Williams was unharmed and mostly unshaken choosing to continue on with his tour of the Upper Peninsula. He used the attack to his political advantage blaming it on budget cuts made by the Republican-controlled Michigan Legislature. Later in the same year Williams gained prominence for his refusal to extradite Haywood Patterson one of the Scottsboro Boys who had escaped from prison in Alabama in 1948 and hidden in Detroit for two years.

Also during Williams' twelve years in office a farm-marketing program was sanctioned teachers' salaries school facilities and educational programs were improved and there were also commissions formed to research problems related to aging sex offenders and adolescence behavior.

Williams named the first woman judge in the state's history as well as the first black.   As a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1956 he unsuccessfully sought the vice-presidential nomination. At the 1952 1956 and 1960 conventions he fought for insertion of a strong  civil rights plank in the party platform. He strongly opposed the selection of Lyndon Baines Johnson as vice president in 1960 feeling that Johnson was ""ideologically wrong on civil rights."" Williams made public his opposition shouting ""No"" when a call was made for Johnson's nomination to be made unanimous. He was the only delegate to publicly oppose Johnson's nomination.

His final term in office was marked by high-profile struggles with the Republican-controlled state legislature and a near-shutdown of the state government. He therefore chose not to seek reelection in 1960. Williams left office on January 1 1961 his 12 years in office ultimately surpassed only by William Milliken (who served 14 years as governor).

There is a substantial poultry industry with 755000 birds counted in 2006.  There is also an intense commercial activity because of the highway traffic. Alexânia is also an important cluster of ‘Cachaça de alambique’ (artisanal sugar cane rum). The major ones are: Cambeba Cachaça do Ministro Cana Brava Cachaça do Piloto.  There were two bank branches in 2007.

The municipality still has a relatively unspoilt nature with some forest growth along the rivers.  In recent years several rural hotels (‘hotéis-fazendas’) have opened up near the town offering what is known as eco-tourism to the urban inhabitants of Brasília. This activity supports more than 200 families.

Recently a beer brewery was established in the municipality providing needed jobs and giving the region the possibility of finally developing and benefiting from a higher standard of living.

32,Andorra,Politics,"



Andorra is a parliamentary co-principality with the President of France and the Catholic Bishop of Urgell (Catalonia Spain) as Co-Princes. This peculiarity makes the President of France in his capacity as Prince of Andorra an elected reigning monarch although he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people. The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democracy whereby the Head of Government is the chief executive and of a pluriform multi-party system.

The current Head of Government is Antoni Martí of the Democrats for Andorra (DA). Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both government and parliament.

The Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council. The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 Councillors. The Councillors serve for four-year terms and elections are held between the 30th and 40th days following the dissolution of the previous Council.

Half are elected in equal numbers by each of the seven administrative parishes and the other half of the Councillors are elected in a single national constituency. Fifteen days after the election the Councillors hold their inauguration. During this session the Syndic General who is the head of the General Council and the Subsyndic General his assistant are elected. Eight days later the Council convenes once more. During this session the Head of Government is chosen from among the Councillors.

Casa de la Vall Andorran Parliament

Candidates can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the Councillors. The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be Head of Government. The Syndic General then notifies the Co-Princes who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the Head of Government of Andorra. The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws. Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members' Bills by three of the local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra.

The Council also approves the annual budget of the principality. The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires. If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved. Once any bill is approved the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Co-Princes so that they may sign and enact it.

If the Head of Government is not satisfied with the Council he may request that the Co-Princes dissolve the Council and order new elections. In turn the Councillors have the power to remove the Head of Government from office. After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the Councillors the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes the Head of Government is removed.

697137,Legends of Motorsport,Original Series,"The series was attributed to the German automobile firm BMW implying that they provided some of its key financial backing.  The series also included a three-part set of episodes entitled ''The History of BMW Motorsport''.

Approximately 200 half-hour episodes were made and aired between the years 1996 and 2000 all based around vintage automobile (and motorcycle) footage.

The majority of the episodes consisted of an apparently complete old documentary film (sometimes with scratches) produced by an automotive vendor.  Castrol Girling Triumph BRSCC and many others were the producers of those original publicity films.  Although wrapped with a modern introduction and interspersed with occasional clarifying breaks the original narration from the film was used several of them done by Graham Walker (Murray Walker's motorcycle-racing father). Most of the films focussed on racing.  Others focussed on chronicling a firm's history or showing their production methods.  Most if not all were introduced and elucidated by one of David Hobbs or Alain de Cadenet.

For a few episodes Alain de Cadenet provided narration in addition to introduction and elucidation.  In at least one case ''Death and Games Le Mans 1963'' this was because the film had been produced in German.  In other cases the film coverage of the topic was probably extracted from several archival sources.  In particular  the multi-part set of ''Legends of Motorsport'' episodes entitled ""Racing in the Fifties"" had one episode for each year of the 1950s with footage for each coming from multiple unattributed archival sources.

118253,Blind Guardian,Biography,"
===Formation as Lucifer's Heritage (1984–1987)===
Blind Guardian was formed in 1984 in Krefeld Germany by Hansi Kürsch (vocals bass) and Andre Olbrich (guitar) under the name Lucifer's Heritage with Markus Dörk (guitar) and Thomen Stauch (drums). The band briefly expanded into a quintet with the addition of a second lead vocalist Thomas Kelleners. However after three months Kelleners left the band in a mutual agreement. Lucifer's Heritage first released two demos in 1985 and 1986 despite undergoing chaotic lineup changes: Dörk and Stauch were replaced by Christof Theißen and Hans-Peter Frey respectively. Finally in 1987 Marcus Siepen joined and Thomen came back to form the lineup which would stay consistent for the next 18 years.

===Name change and rise to success (1988–1996)===
After Lucifer's Heritage signed a contract with No Remorse Records the band changed their name to Blind Guardian to avoid any speculations about Satanism (in a bio it was stated that they also wanted to distance themselves from the black metal movement as their demos were placed in with black metal albums at local record shops). They released their debut album ''Battalions of Fear'' in 1988 which was essentially a speed metal album heavily influenced by Helloween. These two German bands had close ties and Helloween founder Kai Hansen made a guest appearance on Blind Guardian's second LP ''Follow the Blind'' (1989) where the band revealed some thrash metal influence. Their third LP ''Tales from the Twilight World'' (1990) had a much more melodic and ""epic"" feeling with usage of choir and classical music influence.

Blind Guardian signed with Virgin Records in 1991 and released their fourth studio album ''Somewhere Far Beyond'' in 1992 and the live album ''Tokyo Tales'' in 1993. Flemming Rasmussen former Metallica producer began working with the band in 1994 producing their fifth studio album ''Imaginations from the Other Side'' released in 1995 and ''The Forgotten Tales'' an album that contained half covers and half original work released in 1996.

===Later years and departure of Thomen Stauch (1997–2009)===
Lead vocalist Hansi Kürsch
In 1998 Blind Guardian released their epic album ''Nightfall in Middle-Earth''. ""Complete with anthemic choruses spoken word story lines and plenty of bombastic power metal punctuating every dramatic turn"" says Allmusic's Vincent Jeffries ""Nightfall in Middle-Earth is perhaps Blind Guardian's most triumphant"". A concept album based on J. R. R. Tolkien's ''The Silmarillion'' Blind Guardian's music demonstrated some folk rock influence but also featured heavy use of Queen-style layered backing vocals. Since ''Nightfall'' bass guitar has been played by sessional member Oliver Holzwarth and Hansi has been able to devote all his attention to singing. ''Nightfall'' was also the last Blind Guardian album produced by Rasmussen.

''A Night at the Opera'' named after the Queen album was released four years later. On this album the band's sound lacked almost all influence of their original speed metal. Power and progressive metal abound with over the top orchestral backing and a consistent vocal and guitar layering throughout. Though not a true concept album many of the lyrics dealt with the common themes of religion and relations between human and divine powers. It was followed by a live album in 2003 and a DVD ''Imaginations Through the Looking Glass'' in 2004 which was the last recorded Blind Guardian material to feature Thomen Stauch on drums. He left the band due to musical differences and was replaced by Frederik Ehmke. The first album with Ehmke was ''A Twist in the Myth'' which came out in 2006.

Blind Guardian participated in the soundtrack for the ''In the Name of the King: a Dungeon Siege Tale'' fantasy movie (Uwe Boll) which came out in 2008. The band also recorded a theme song for ''Sacred 2 Fallen Angel'' role-playing video game the sequel to ''Sacred''.

===''At the Edge of Time'' ''Beyond the Red Mirror'' and upcoming albums (2010–present)===
Blind Guardian in 2009
""A Voice in the Dark"" was the next single from Blind Guardian that was released June 25 2010.
On July 30 2010 the album followed called ''At the Edge of Time''. The band started ""The Sacred Worlds and Songs Divine Tour 2010"" the European dates featured the opening acts Enforcer and Steelwing.  The US dates had Holy Grail and Seven Kingdoms and later they were announced that they would play at Wacken Open Air in 2011.

On July 21 2011 Hansi Kürsch announced on Blind Guardian's official website that they were working on an orchestral album. On September 1 2011 Oliver Holzwarth joined Rhapsody of Fire as a full-time member after 13 years as Blind Guardian's session bass player. On January 27 2012 the band released a compilation album titled ''Memories of a Time to Come'' containing re-recorded and remixed songs from the band's entire discography and almost exactly year later on January 28 2013 they released a box set called ''A Traveler's Guide to Space and Time'' which contained all of the bands' studio live and compilation albums released from 1988 to 2004 as well as some previously unreleased material. On July 11 2012 Hansi posted on the bands' official website that the band would cease touring after their show at the Rockharz festival in Ballenstedt which happened two days after the post. Hansi went on in the post to explain that they wanted to really get down to work and focus on a new record before returning to the road once again in 2014 at the latest. He also mentioned that he really wanted to perform songs that they had never played live before when they return to touring.

In October 2013 the band were announced to be headlining the Out & Loud Festival in Geiselwind on May 31 2014. On October 18 2013 Hansi announced via a news post on the official website that he expected the new record to be fully produced and finished by May 2014. He mentioned that the production of the album was coming along well and mentioned nine new songs by name (''Irish Hill'' now titled ''Grand Parade'' ''Encrypted Time'' ''Prophecies'' ''Holy Grail'' ''Winter's Coming'' ''The Throne'' ''The Ocean'' and ''Outcast'') and two other songs with presumably uncertain titles ''Song 9'' and ''Midtempo Song''. The tenth Blind Guardian album titled ''Beyond the Red Mirror'' was released on January 30 2015 and its first single ""Twilight of the Gods"" was released on December 5 2014. On January 28 2015 two days before the release of ''Beyond the Red Mirror'' Blind Guardian announced on their official Facebook page that Barend Courbois is their new session/live bassist.

It was announced that they were currently recording their live shows during the 2015 Beyond the Red Mirror U.S. tour for a then-upcoming live album. The new live album ''Live Beyond the Spheres'' was announced to be released on July 7 2017. When asked in July 2017 about the next Blind Guardian album Kürsch stated ""We haven't done too much songwriting for the next regular Blind Guardian album but still we've made some steps at least and I can sense a strong change in comparison to what we did on the last album. There's one song called 'Architect of Doom' which is a real heavy song. Very powerful. Very thrashy at points. And there's another song called 'American Goth' which is kind of what you would expect from Blind Guardian but yet the way we maintained the drums for example the way we maintained the orchestra and that is a song with orchestra again it's so different. I'm pretty sure that there will be a significant change when you listen to these two albums and from that point of view yes ''Live Beyond the Spheres'' is the end of an era."" He also stated that they are working on an orchestral album which was originally scheduled to be finished and released in 2016 but now due for release in 2019 followed by a ""heavy album"" to be released in 2020.

320388,Labor induction,Methods of induction,"Methods of inducing labor include both pharmacological medication and mechanical or physical approaches.

Mechanical and physical approaches can include artificial rupture of membranes or membrane sweeping.  The use of intrauterine catheters are also indicated. These work by compressing the cervix mechanically to generate release on prostaglandins in local tissues. There is no direct effect on the uterus.

Pharmacological methods are mainly using either dinoprostone (prostaglandin E2) or misoprostol (a prostaglandin E1 analogue)

===Medication===
* Intravaginal endocervical or extra-amniotic administration of prostaglandin such as dinoprostone or misoprostol. Prostaglandin E2 is the most studied compound and with most evidence behind it.  A range of different dosage forms are available with a variety of routes possible.  The use of misoprostol has been extensively studied but normally in small poorly defined studies. Only a very few countries have approved misoprostol for use in induction of labor. 
* Intravenous administration of synthetic oxytocin preparations. A high dose does not seem to have greater benefits than a standard dose.
* Use of mifepristone has been described but is rarely used in practice.
* Relaxin has been investigated but is not currently commonly used.
* mnemonic; ARNOP: Antiprogesterone relaxin nitric oxide donors oxytocin prostaglandins

===Non-pharmaceutical===

* ""Membrane sweep"" also known as membrane stripping or ""stretch and sweep"" in Australia and the UK – during an internal examination the practitioner moves their finger around the cervix to stimulate and/or separate the membranes around the baby from the cervix.  This causes a release of prostaglandins which can help to kick-start labor.
* Artificial rupture of the membranes (AROM or ARM) (""breaking the waters"")
* Extra-amniotic saline infusion (EASI) in which a Foley catheter is inserted into the cervix and the distal portion expanded to dilate it and to release prostaglandins.

296826,Battle of Sishui Pass,The battle,"===First blood===
Bao Xin one of the coalition leaders wanting to get merit before Sun Jian did secretly sent his brother Bao Zhong with 3000 men through a shortcut towards Sishui Pass. Hua Xiong charged out of the pass and slew Bao Zhong. He then sent Bao Zhong's head back to Dong Zhuo as a token of his victory and Dong promoted him.

Sun Jian arrived at the pass with his generals Cheng Pu Huang Gai Han Dang and Zu Mao. Hu Zhen led 5000 men to engage Sun Jian but Cheng Pu stabbed him in the throat with his spear soon after they clashed. Sun Jian then continued to the pass where he was repelled by the archers. He retreated to Liangdong (梁東) and reported his victory to Yuan Shao while pressing Yuan Shu for provisions.

===Sun Jian defeated===
Yuan Shu refused to send the supplies because he did not want Sun Jian to gain the top credit. Chaos broke out in Sun Jian's army due to the lack of supplies and spies in his camp reported the situation to Hua Xiong. Li Su suggested to Hua Xiong to seize the opportunity to attack Sun Jian.

At midnight Hua Xiong led an army to attack the front of Sun Jian's camp so Sun came out and fought with him. A separate force led by Li Su sneaked into Sun Jian's camp from the rear and set fire. By then Sun Jian had been surrounded and he attempted to break out of the encirclement together with Zu Mao. Seeing that Sun Jian's red scarf could easily identify him Zu Mao suggested to his lord to give him the scarf which Sun did. Sun Jian then escaped while Zu Mao used the scarf as a bait to lure Hua Xiong into a trap. Zu Mao attempted to catch Hua Xiong off guard but failed and was killed by Hua.

Cheng Pu Huang Gai Han Dang eventually regrouped with Sun Jian who mourned the death of Zu Mao and reported his defeat to Yuan Shao.

===Guan Yu slays Hua Xiong===
The following day Hua Xiong rode towards the coalition camp and taunted them to fight him one-to-one. Yu She a general under Yuan Shu answered Hua Xiong's challenge but was killed in a few rounds. Pan Feng a general under Han Fu took up the challenge but lost his life as well.

Guan Yu who was only a mounted archer under Liu Bei (who joined the coalition under Gongsun Zan's banner) then volunteered to fight Hua Xiong but was ridiculed by Yuan Shu because of his low rank. However Cao Cao suggested that they allow Guan Yu to go since the latter was brave enough to volunteer anyway. Guan Yu promised to take Hua Xiong's head and if he failed he would face execution. Cao Cao offered Guan Yu a cup of warm wine to encourage him but the latter declined claiming that he would return very soon. Within moments Guan Yu returned with Hua Xiong's head and he proceeded to gulp down the wine which was still warm.

The coalition forces took advantage of the situation to seize Sishui Pass and advance towards Hulao Pass the next mountain pass on the way to Luoyang.

Information signs have been growing in visibility due to the explosion of sign technologies. For hundreds if not thousands of years signs were crafted out of wood. Words and images were then hand-painted on the sign. The other traditional way of creating signs dealt with individual constructed letters carved from wood molded or wrought from metal which were then individually placed in the appropriate sequence.

While both of these methods are still employed technology has moved in around them. Woodworking machinery can now be controlled by computers leading to much greater consistency. Molded signage has changed dramatically with the advent of plastics which are far more flexible than metal as well as significantly cheaper to produce. Additionally altogether new sign technologies have come into being such as computer-cut vinyl signage..

375630,CHNO-FM,History of CHNO,"
The station began broadcasting on June 24 1947 on AM 1440. It was a bilingual radio station airing programming in both English and French and was an affiliate of both CBC Radio's Dominion Network and Radio-Canada. It was operated by ''Sudbury Broadcasting'' a company owned by F. Baxter Ricard and his wife Alma Ricard and was the first bilingual radio station in Canada outside of Quebec. On November 9 1954 CHNO moved to AM 900.

In 1957 Ricard opened CFBR on AM 550 as a full-time French-language station and CHNO switched to full-time English. The licensing of CFBR which took over the Radio-Canada affiliation from CHNO made Sudbury Broadcasting the first commercial broadcaster in Canada licensed to operate two AM radio stations in the same city. On December 31 1969 CFBR and CHNO swapped frequencies CHNO moving to 550 and CFBR taking over the 900 slot. On May 14 1976 the CRTC denied an application by Sudbury Broadcasting Co. Ltd. to change CHNO's frequency from 550 kHz to 570 kHz.

In 1980 Sudbury Broadcasting launched a new FM station CJMX. That same year CHNO received approval to increase daytime power from 10000 watts to 50000 watts with the nighttime power to remain at 10000 watts and would remain on 550 kHz. Also in 1980 Ricard also became a major shareholder in Mid-Canada Communications. Sudbury Broadcasting continued to operate independently although it was eventually merged into Mid-Canada Radio in 1985. In 1990 Mid-Canada sold the stations to Pelmorex. Following this sale CFBR adopted the new call letters CHYC.

In the 1970s and 1980s CHNO was Northern Ontario's most listened-to and most influential radio station broadcasting a Top 40 format branded as ""55 CHNO"" ""Rock Radio CHNO 55"" ""Sudbury's Best Rock"" and ""Sudbury's Hit Music Leader NO55"" (pronounced ""N-oh fifty-five""). However the 1990 launch of CJRQ ended CHNO's dominance and in July 1992 CHNO flipped to an oldies format as ""Oldies 55"". After struggling through a variety of formats including classic rock as ""AM 55 The Crusher"" in 1994 country and talk radio in 1995 and 1996 the station reverted to oldies in 1997. Former program director Scott Jackson now the manager of CJLF-FM in Barrie has stated that CHNO and CJMX were the most neglected stations in the entire Pelmorex corporate family during the time that he worked there despite being the network's nominal flagships.

In 1998 Pelmorex sold CJMX to Telemedia. The following year Pelmorex sold CHNO and CHYC to Haliburton Broadcasting Group.

725418,Wilmington Quicksteps,Introduction,"The '''Wilmington Quicksteps''' (also known as the '''Quickstep Club of Wilmington''') were an 1884 late-season replacement baseball team in the Union Association. They finished with a 2-16 record and were managed by Joe Simmons. The team played home games in Union Street Park in Wilmington Delaware.

In 1883 the Inter-State Association of Professional Baseball Clubs was founded and local capital was invested for a franchise in Wilmington. In 1884 The Interstate Association re-organized under the name ""Eastern League"" (not to be confused with the double A Eastern League of today); this was one of the very first ""minor leagues"" and is considered a forerunner of today's AAA International League.

The Wilmington Quicksteps quickly began to dominate the league. So highly regarded was the club that major league clubs began to show up to play exhibition games; they defeated both the Washington Nationals and the Baltimore Monumentals during the season. By August the Quicksteps had already sewed up the league championship with a 50-12 record. Unfortunately their dominance nearly destroyed fan interest in the Eastern League; even in Wilmington attendance averaged only 400 per game.

Late into the season Henry Lucas the Union Association founder and owner of the St. Louis Maroons convinced Simmons and the Quicksteps to cross over into his league when the Philadelphia Keystones folded due to lack of attendance. After winning their first game 4-3 over Washington it was all downhill for the Quicksteps. Many Wilmington players no longer felt bound by their contracts and signed for more money with other teams in their new league; shortstop and team Captain Oyster Burns jumped to the Baltimore Monumentals for $900 a month and outfielder Dennis Casey also jumped to Baltimore for $700 a month; each had been making about $150 a month in Wilmington. Catcher Andy Cusick went to the Philadelphia Phillies for $375 a month and the only star player to remain in Wilmington was pitcher Ed ""The Only"" Nolan who went on to beat Washington for Wilmington's second and last victory. But the Quicksteps could not survive the loss of Burns Casey and Cusick; the team finished with a batting average of only .175 in the Union Association.

By this time however St. Louis had already won the pennant; as Wilmington was just being used to fill in the last month of the season Simmons pulled his team from the field and disbanded them on September 21 1884 after discovering that he would be unable to pay the $60 gate fee to the visiting Kansas City Cowboys as the attendance was zero. Wilmington was replaced in the Union Association by the Milwaukee Brewers.

26316,War of the Austrian Succession,Campaign of 1744,"Louis XV of France by Maurice Quentin de La Tour (1748) Pastel painting
With 1744 began the Second Silesian War. Frederick of Prussia was disquieted by the universal success of the Austrians and their alliance with Sardinia. Accordingly he secretly concluded another fresh alliance with Louis XV of France. France had posed hitherto as an auxiliary its officers in Germany had worn the Bavarian cockade and only with Britain was it officially at war. France now declared war directly upon Austria and Sardinia (April 1744).

At this point France also planned a diversion which they hope would cause Britain to leave the war. A French army was assembled at Dunkirk to support the cause of Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie) in an invasion of Great Britain. Prince Charles was son of James Francis Edward Stuart Stuart pretender to the British throne who was the son of James II the last Catholic and last Stuart king of England. James II had been deposed as the King of England in 1688 in favour of his daughter Mary and her husband the Protestant Prince of Orange--William III of the house of Orange-Nassau. There remained a significant element of the population of the British Isles that hoped for the return of the Stuart family as monarchs. King Louis XIV of France had shown great support for Stuart cause. Indeed in 1715 France had sponsored an uprising in Scotland which the pretender James had joined but it was defeated. Forbidden to return to France by the new king Louis XV James sought sanctuary elsewhere. Finally Pope Clement XI offered James and his family the use of Palazzo Muti and a lifetime annuity of 8000 Roman scudi. It was here in the Palazzo Muti that Charles Edward Stuart was born and had lived his whole life.

Charles had much more charisma than his father and now Louis XV was favourably disposed toward helping him create another uprising in Scotland. Louis XV sent Drummond of Balhaldy as an emissary to the Stuart ""court"" in Rome. French plans called for Charles to be in Dunkirk France to assemble with the fleet on 10 January 1744 yet Balhaldy had only arrived in Rome on 19 December 1743. Thus there was very little time to waste. On 23 December 1743 Charles' father named him ""Prince Regent"" so that Charles could act in his own name. In the spring of 1744 Prince Charles secretly arrived in France and was about to board the ships that would take him to England. However on the night before he was to board a fierce storm blew up (this storm became known as the ""Protestant Wind"") and wrecked or dispersed the entire fleet. The violent storms had wrecked the crossing attempt and the planned invasion was abandoned. However Charles did not give up hope of restoring the Stuart family to the throne of England.

During naval operations that were possible preparations for the return of Charles Edward Stuart to England and a coordinated French invasion of England there occurred on 22 February 1744 the largest sea battle of the war. This naval battle took place in the Mediterranean off the coast of Toulon France. A large British fleet under the command of Admiral Thomas Mathews with Rear Admiral Richard Lestock second in command was blockading the French coast. A smaller French and Spanish naval force attacked the British blockade and damaged some of the British ships forcing the British to withdraw and seek repairs. Thus the British blockade of the French coast was relieved and the Spanish fleet apparently controlled the Mediterranean Sea. A Spanish squadron took refuge in the harbour at Toulon. The British fleet watched this squadron carefully from a harbour a short distance to the east. On 21 February 1744 the Spanish ships put to sea with a French fleet. Admiral Mathews took his British fleet and attacked the Spanish fleet from 22 February until 23 February 1744 in what has become known as the Battle of Toulon. However because of mis-communication and possibly treachery on the part of Rear Admiral Lestock the smaller Spanish fleet was allowed to escape. With the knowledge that a larger French fleet was sailing to the rescue the British ships broke off combat and retreated to the northeast.

Although technically the Battle of Toulon was regarded as a victory for Britain in Britain it was feared by the public that the combined French and Spanish ships were making for the Straits of Gibraltar and for a gathering of ships at Brest for a planned invasion of England. As a consequence bitter recriminations were brought against Admiral Mathews for letting this Spanish-French fleet get away and subsequently placing England in danger of invasion. Consequently both Mathews and Lestock were tried in naval court. Lestock was acquitted (unjustly according to some) while Mathews was found guilty (also regarded as an injustice by some commentators).

Warfare between Deggendorf and Vilshofen Bavaria

Meanwhile on the battlefields in northern Europe Louis XV in person with 90000 men invaded the Austrian Netherlands and took Menin and Ypres in July 1744. His presumed opponent although shorn of the Russians still consisted the same allied army previously commanded by King George II and composed of British Dutch German (Hanoverian) and Austrian troops.

The French put four armies into the field. On the Rhine Marshal Coigny had 57000 troops up against 70000 allied troops under the command of Prince Charles. A fresh army of over 30000 soldiers under the Prince de Conti was located between the Meuse and Moselle Rivers which would later assist the Spaniards in Piedmont and Lombardy. This plan was however at once dislocated by the advance of Prince Charles who assisted by the veteran Marshal Traun skillfully manoeuvred his allied army over the Rhine near Philippsburg on 1 July 1744 and captured the lines of Weissenburg and cut off Marshal Coigny and his army from Alsace.

A third French Army composed of 17000 men under the command of Duke d' Harcourt kept Luxembourg at bay Meanwhile the fourth French army was the largest army that put to field in the summer of 1744. This was the Army of Flanders. Numbering 87000 men and was officially under the command of the king of France—Louis XV but in actuality Louis XV was being militarily advised by Marshal Noailles. As these French forces invaded the Austrian Netherlands they outnumbered the allied armies by about a four to three ratio. Furthermore as they marched into the Austrian Netherlands they met a confused resistance offered by Dutch forces. Consequently the French Army of Flanders made rapid progress across the Austrian Netherlands. The situation became so desperate for the Dutch that the Dutch government sent an envoy to the king of France to seek peace. This plea for peace was rejected by the French.

However the situation in the Austrian Netherlands was changed abruptly by the successful crossing of the Rhine on 30 June 1744 by Prince Charles and his 70000-man allied army. Marshal Coigny caught far in advance of the other French forces cut his way back through the enemy at Weissenburg and withdrew towards Strasbourg. Louis XV now abandoned the invasion of the Southern Netherlands and his army moved down to take a decisive part in the war in Alsace and Lorraine.

Military camp: war of the Austrian succession

Finally on 12 July 1744 Frederick II of Prussia received confirmation that Prince Charles had taken his army beyond the Rhine and into France. Thus Frederick knew that Prince Charles would not be able to present any immediate problem to him in the east. Consequently on 15 August 1744 Frederick II crossed the Austrian frontier into Bohemia. By late August all 80000 of his troops were in Bohemia. The attention and resources of Austria had been fully occupied for some time on a renewal of the war in Silesia. However neither Maria Theresa nor her advisers had expected the Prussians to march as quickly as they did. Accordingly Frederick's invasion of Bohemia came as a surprise to the Austrian court and Frederick was almost unopposed in Bohemia. One column consisting of 40000 troops under Frederick's own command passed through Saxony; another column of 16000 men under the command of ""Young Dessauer"" passed through Lusatia while a third consisting of 16000 soldiers under Count Schwerin advanced from Silesia. The destination for all three columns was Prague. The objective was reached on 2 September. The city was surrounded and besieged. Six days later the Austrian garrison was compelled to surrender. Scarcely had Prague surrendered to Frederick II than he was off marching southwards leaving 5000 soldiers under General Baron Gottfried Emanual von Einsiedel to garrison Prague. Three days after the fall of Prague Frederick marched with his army marching southwards and seized Tabor Budweis and Frauenberg.

Maria Theresa once again rose to the emergency a new ""insurrection"" took the field in Hungary and a corps of regulars was assembled to cover Vienna. Meanwhile Austrian diplomats won over Saxony to the Austrian side. Because of Frederick's successful campaign in Bohemia Prince Charles sought to withdraw from Alsace and cross the Rhine once again and strike at the Prussians. At this point the French had an excellent chance to strike at Prince Charles while he was in a vulnerable position—crossing the Rhine. However the French military command was distracted and could not take any action at all and Prince Charles was able to cross the Rhine once again unmolested by the French. The French had been unable to act because they were thrown into confusion by King Louis XV suddenly becoming very ill with smallpox at Metz. The King's condition was so severe that many feared for his life. Only Count Seckendorf commander of the Bavarians pursued Prince Charles. No move was made by the French and Frederick thus found himself isolated and exposed to the combined attack of the Austrians and Saxons. Count Traun summoned from the Rhine held the king in check in Bohemia with a united force of Austrians and Saxons. The Hungarian irregulars also inflicted numerous minor reverses on the Prussians. Finally Prince Charles arrived with the main army from the west. The campaign resembled that of 1742: the Prussian retreat was closely watched and the rearguard pressed hard. Prague fell and Frederick was completely outmanoeuvred by the united forces of Prince Charles and Count Traun. Frederick was forced to retreat to Silesia with heavy losses. However the Austrians gained no foothold in Silesia itself. On the Rhine Louis XV now recovered had besieged and taken Freiburg after which the forces left in the north were reinforced and besieged the strong places of Southern Netherlands. There was also a slight war of manoeuvre on the middle Rhine.

394844,Sullivan Correctional Facility,Introduction,"

The prison annex

'''Sullivan Correctional Facility''' is a New York State maximum security correctional facility for male prisoners located in Fallsburg New York. It is operated by the New York State Department of Correctional Services. It is a maximum security prison for male inmates.

Sullivan is located on an 850-acre (3.4 km²) stretch of land that also contains Woodbourne Correctional Facility a medium-security prison. The state appropriated funding for Sullivan after the loss of Rikers Island as a state facility in 1980 (the facility was returned to New York City). The buildings were built on a sharp upslope overlooking the Neversink River valley.

In order to build access roads to the prison the New York State Department of Correctional Services purchased the Lebowitz Pine View Hotel the 62 acre (0.25 km²) adjoining property in 1983. Originally some prisoners from the Woodburne facility were transferred and housed in the hotel buildings which were operated as a Woodburne annex until the completion of Sullivan in 1985. It operated as a minimum security Sullivan annex until 2010 when the annex portion was closed.

Sullivan currently houses between 560 and 580 inmates in four pods arranged in a circle. Eighty-six percent of those inmates are being incarcerated for committing violent felonies and 60% are serving life sentences

 Hudson Link for Higher Education in Prison a not-for-profit organization was founded to provide college education to incarcerated people in an effort to help reduce recidivism and poverty while strengthening families and communities. In 1998 as part of the get-tough-on-crime campaign state and federal funding for college programs inside prison was stopped. Understanding the positive effects of education in the transformation and rehabilitation of incarcerated people inmates at Sing Sing Correctional Facility reached out to religious and academic volunteers to develop a college-degree granting program. Under the leadership of Dr. Anne Reissner Hudson Link for Higher Education in Prison was founded to restore college education at Sing Sing through private funding. Hudson Link now runs pre-college and college degree programs at Fishkill Greene Sing Sing Sullivan and Taconic Correctional Facilities.

32648,Denim,Dry or raw denim,"
'''Dry''' or '''raw denim''' (contrasted with ""washed denim"") is denim that is not washed after having been dyed during production.
Denim fibers from an old pair of jeans through a microscope
Over time dry denim will fade considered fashionable in some circumstances. During the process of wear fading will usually occur on those parts of the article that receive the most stress. On a pair of jeans this includes the upper thighs the ankles and the areas behind the knees.

After being made into an article of clothing most denim articles are washed to make them softer and to reduce or eliminate shrinkage (which could cause the article to not fit properly after its owner washes it). In addition to being washed ""washed denim"" is sometimes artificially distressed to produce a ""worn"" look. Much of the appeal of artificially distressed denim is that it resembles dry denim which has faded. In jeans made from dry denim such fading is affected by the body of the person who wears them and by the activities of their daily life. This process creates what many enthusiasts feel to be a look more ""natural"" than artificially distressed denim.

To facilitate the natural distressing process some wearers of dry denim will abstain from washing their jeans for more than six months.
Most dry denim is made with 100% cotton and comes from several different countries. In particular the United States Zimbabwe and Japan are popular sources of cotton for making raw denim.

Dry denim also varies in weight typically measured in by the weight of a yard of denim in ounces. 12 oz. or less is considered light denim 12 oz. to 16 oz. is considered mid-weight and over 16 oz. is considered heavyweight. Heavier denim is much more rigid and resistant to wear but can also take a larger number of wears to break in and feel comfortable.

Natural ""honeycomb"" fades
Patterns of fading in jeans caused by prolonged periods of wearing them without washing are a way of ""personalizing"" the garment.

These patterns have specific names:
* combs or honeycombs – meshes of faded line-segments that form behind the knees
* whiskers – faded streaks that form radially from the crotch area
* stacks – irregular bands of fading above the ankle caused by according of the fabric due to contact with the foot or shoe
* train tracks – fading along the out-seams due to abrasion

397085,Manhattan Regional Airport,History,"On June 13 1939 construction of Manhattan’s airport began with the planting of temporary grass runways.  The facility was dedicated in November 1940.  The first ""Manhattan Municipal Airport"" terminal was dedicated on April 19 1953 with U.S. Senator Frank Carlson providing an address. Commercial airline flights began earlier that month.

The current commercial airline terminal opened in two phases between 2015-2016 and replaced the previous 1997 terminal.

123223,Keira Knightley,Career,"
===1993–2002: Career beginnings and breakthrough===
After getting an agent at the age of six Knightley began working in commercials and small television roles. Her first on-screen appearance was in the 1993 television film ''Royal Celebration''. She then played Natasha Jordan a young girl whose mother is involved in an extramarital affair in the romantic drama ''A Village Affair'' (1995). After having appeared in such roles in a spate of television films through the mid-to-late 1990s including ''Innocent Lies'' (1995) ''The Treasure Seekers'' (1996) ''Coming Home'' (1998) and ''Oliver Twist'' (1999) Knightley landed the role of Sabé Padmé Amidala's handmaiden and decoy in the 1999 science fiction blockbuster ''Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace''. Her dialogue was dubbed over by Natalie Portman who played Padmé. Knightley was cast in the role because of her close resemblance to Portman; even the two actresses' mothers had difficulty telling their daughters apart when they were in full makeup.

In her first major role the 2001 Walt Disney Productions feature film ''Princess of Thieves'' Knightley played the daughter of Robin Hood. To prepare for the film she trained for several weeks in archery fencing and horse riding. During this time Knightley also appeared in ''The Hole'' a thriller that received a direct-to-video release in the United States. The film's director Nick Hamm described her as ""a young version of Julie Christie"". Knightley took on the role of Lara Antipova in the miniseries adaptation of ''Doctor Zhivago''. The series co-starring Scottish actor Hans Matheson in the title role first aired in 2002 to good reviews and high ratings. In the same year Knightley took on the role of a pregnant drug addict in Gillies MacKinnon's drama film ''Pure''. Co-starring Molly Parker and Harry Eden the film had its world premiere at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. In a retrospect review Carlo Cavagna of AboutFilm.com noted Knightley's screen presence and wrote that though she ""doesn't have half of Parker's ability ... shines brightly in ''Pure''"".

Despite having appeared in over a dozen film and television roles Knightley struggled to get a breakthrough. That changed in 2002 when she starred in Gurinder Chadha's sports comedy film ''Bend It Like Beckham'' which was a smash hit both in the UK and the United States grossing over $76.6 million. It also surprised film critics who were laudatory of its ""charming"" and ""inspiring"" nature social context and the cast's performances. Knightley and her co-star Parminder Nagra who played the central roles of aspiring footballers attracted international attention for their performances in the film. To prepare for their roles they underwent three months of extensive football training under the English football coach Simon Clifford. Knightley who was initially skeptical of the project went on to win the London Film Critics' Circle for Best Newcomer and the Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Breakthrough Performance. In an interview with Tracy Smith she said ""I remember telling friends I was doing this girls' soccer movie ... And nobody thought that it was gonna be any good."" Film critic James Berardinelli who was largely laudatory of the film and the ""energetic and likable"" cast noted that Knightley and Nagra brought ""a lot of spirit to their instantly likable characters"".

===2003–07: Worldwide recognition===
Following the success of ''Bend It Like Beckham'' Knightley landed the role of Elizabeth Swann in the 2003 American fantasy swashbuckler film ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl''. The film which was based on the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Disney theme parks saw Knightley Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp play the roles of 18th century pirates. Despite boasting the names of Hollywood stars like Depp and Bloom and a hefty $135 million budget ''Pirates'' was not the most anticipated release of the year and was expected to fail at the box-office. Knightley herself was not optimistic about its prospects : ""I remember being on set just sort of going 'OK what is this? Is this any good?"" However contrary to the expectations the film opened at no. 1 on the box-office and went to become one of the highest grossing productions of the year with the worldwide collections of $654 million.

Knightley appeared in the $247 million grossing British romantic comedy ''Love Actually''. The film had an ensemble cast including her childhood idol Emma Thompson among others. The film opened in November 2003 to positive critical reception. Knightley's sole release of 2004 was the historical film ''King Arthur'' where she played the role of a warrior and the wife of the titlular character Guinevere. To prepare for the role she took boxing fighting archery and horse-riding lessons for three months. Although the film garnered unfavorable reviews Knightley's stature as a performer grew; she was voted by the readers of ''Hello'' magazine as the industry's most promising teen star ahead of Scarlett Johannson and featured in ''Time'' magazine's article stating that she seemed dedicated to develop herself as a serious actress rather than a film star.

Kinghtley appeared in three films in 2005 the first of which was the psychological thriller ''The Jacket'' co-starring Adrien Brody. In a mixed review for ''Empire'' Kim Newman wrote that the role was unlike the ones that Knighley had previously taken up : ""Knightley getting out of period gear and talking American tries to broaden her range and is arguably well-cast"". She next played the title character in Tony Scott's French-American action film ''Domino'' based on the life of Domino Harvey. The film's release was delayed on multiple occasions and upon its eventual release in November it garnered negative reviews from film critics and poor box-office collections.

Knightley's most successful release of the year was ''Pride & Prejudice'' a period drama based on Jane Austen's novel of the same name. Knightley who admired the book from a young age said of her character ""The beauty of Elizabeth is that every woman who ever reads the book seems to recognise herself with all her faults and imperfections."" Upon release the film became a huge commercial success with total collections of around US$120 million worldwide and garnered positive reviews from critics. Derek Elley of ''Variety'' wrote highly of her performance and screen presence: ""Looking every bit a star Knightley who's shown more spirit than acting smarts so far in her career really steps up to the plate here"". He regarded her ""luminous strength"" to be reminiscent of a young Audrey Hepburn. Knightley earned a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination for her performance becoming the third-youngest nominee for the latter. BAFTA's failure to provide her with a nomination drew criticism from the film's producer Tim Bevan.

Knightley was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences among other artists in 2006. She reprised her role as Elizabeth Swann in the second and third releases of the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' series. The two sequels were conceived in 2004 with the writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio developing a story arc that would span both films. Filming for both the projects took place in 2005 with the ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'' being released in July 2006. With the worldwide collections of $1.066 billion it became the biggest financial hit in Knightley's career. The third installment in the series ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'' was released in May the following year.

Knightley's continued association with period dramas yielded varying results as seen with two of her 2007 releases Francois Girard's ''Silk'' and Joe Wright's ''Atonement'' the feature film adaptations of the novels by Alessandro Baricco and Ian McEwan respectively. While the former project failed at the box office the latter became a critical and commercial success. Knightley garnered widespread acclaim and such accolades as the BAFTA and a nomination for the Golden Globes for her portrayal of Cecilia Tallis the elder of the two Tallis sisters. In preparing for the film where she was seen opposite James McAvoy she studied the ""naturalism"" of the performance as seen in the films from 1930s and 1940s such as ''In Which We Serve'' (1942) and ''Brief Encounter'' (1945). Critic Richard Roeper was puzzled by both Knightley's and McAvoy's Academy Award snubs stating ""I thought McAvoy and Knightley were superb.""

===2008–10: Transition into independent films===
Knightley appeared alongside Sienna Miller Cillian Murphy and Matthew Rhys in John Maybury's 2008 wartime drama ''The Edge of Love''. The film had her play the role of Vera Williams a childhood friend of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas and his wife Caitlin Macnamara. Sharman Macdonald wrote the screenplay with Knightley (her daughter) as Macnamara in her mind. After Knightley was signed to portray Williams the character's role was increased with the film focusing on her romance and marriage with a British soldier. She based her performance on Marlene Dietrich and was to mime to her prerecorded voice prior to being told by Maybury to sing live. Knightley initially felt embarrassed while singing live: ""I was shaking like a leaf"" but eventually went through with the plan. Upon release the film became a moderate critical and commercial success. Knightley's performance and singing abilities were praised by such film citics as Ray Bennett who wrote; ""the film belongs to the women with Knightley going from strength to strength (and showing she can sing!)"".

Knightley then starred as the 18th-century English aristocrat Georgiana Cavendish Duchess of Devonshire in Saul Dibb's widely praised period drama ''The Duchess'' (2008) based on the best-selling biographical novel ''Georgiana Duchess of Devonshire'' by Amanda Foreman. Knightley garnered largely positive reviews for her performance in the film from critics with ''The Epoch Times'' praising her range in the film writing ""she not only perfectly portrays a witty and feminine Georgiana ... but also a caring mother and an abandoned woman."" The following year she was nominated for a BIFA Award for Best Actress for her performance. A film adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragedy ''King Lear'' set to star Knightley and Anthony Hopkins was cancelled due to recession.

Knightley made her West End debut with Martin Crimp's version of Molière's comedy ''The Misanthrope''. Starring Knightley Damian Lewis Tara Fitzgerald and Dominic Rowan the play was staged at London's Comedy Theatre in December 2009. ''The Daily Telegraph'' described her performance as revealing ""both power and poignancy"" and ''The Independent'' called her performance ""not only strikingly convincing but at times rather thrilling in its satiric aplomb."" ''The Guardian'' however noted that due to the nature of the role ""one could say that she is not unduly stretched."" In recognition of her theatre debut Knightley was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in the play. Knightley also received an Evening Standard Award nomination (longlist) for the Natasha Richardson Award for Best Actress.

In 2010 Knightley appeared in Massy Tadjedin's romantic drama ''Last Night'' in which she co-starred with Eva Mendes Sam Worthington and Guillaume Canet. The same year Knightley completed work on an adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's dystopian novel ''Never Let Me Go'' with Andrew Garfield and Carey Mulligan. Filming took place in Norfolk and Clevedon in Somerset. Also in 2010 she starred in ''London Boulevard'' with Colin Farrell written by William Monahan and appeared in a video installation by artist Stuart Pearson Wright titled ''Maze''.

===2011–present: Continued career and Broadway debut===
TIFF premiere of ''A Dangerous Method'' in 2011

Knightley starred in a 2011 stage adaptation of ''The Children's Hour'' by Lillian Hellman at the Comedy Theatre in London. Knightley's only film of 2011 was David Cronenberg's historical drama ''A Dangerous Method'' co-starring Viggo Mortensen Michael Fassbender and Vincent Cassel. Based on writer Christopher Hampton's 2002 stage play ''The Talking Cure'' and set on the eve of World War I the film depicts the turbulent relationships between fledgling psychiatrist Carl Jung his mentor Sigmund Freud and Sabina Spielrein. Spielrein the troubled but beautiful young psychoanalyst who comes between Jung and Freud is played by Knightley. The costume film premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival to a positive reception while Knightley earned generally favourable reviews by critics Andrew O'Hehir of Salon.com noting her ""the real star of this film"".

Knightley co-starred with Steve Carell in the 2012 comedy drama ''Seeking a Friend for the End of the World''. Later that year she reunited with director Joe Wright to film their third production together ''Anna Karenina'' in which she starred as the title character. She deemed her collaboration with Wright as the most important of her career. Knightley garnered positive reviews for her performance prompting early Oscar buzz.

The 2013 Toronto Film Festival saw the release of Knightley's first musical film ''Begin Again'' with Mark Ruffalo. The film which was directed by John Carney had its theatrical release in 2014. Knightley had never sung professionally prior to the project; to prepare for the role of a singer-songwriter she trained with a vocal coach and learned how to play a guitar. Carney later repeatedly criticised Knightley's performance in the film; stating that she was not convincing enough in portraying a singer-songwriter and continuously describing her as a ""model"" rather than an actress. He later apologised to her on Twitter for his comments. Knightley revealed in July that music doesn't ""sink in"" for her and she is more interested in books and drama. Later that year she appeared in Karl Lagerfeld's short period film ''Once Upon a Time..''.

2014 for Knightley began with the spy thriller ''Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit'' alongside Chris Pine. It was based on novelist Tom Clancy's fictional character Jack Ryan and was the fifth film in the Jack Ryan film series. The film received mixed critical reviews nonetheless strong box-office response. Knightley's next film ''Laggies'' (2014) premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival prior to its US general-release on 24 October. A romantic comedy also starring Chloë Grace Moretz and Sam Rockwell the film follows the life of Megan (played by Knightley) a 28 year old underachiever going through a quarter-life crisis. ''Laggies'' opened to mostly positive reviews from critics with Knightley's performance being chiefly praised by critics. Inkoo Kaang of TheWrap wrote of her ""delightfully uncouth"" performance: ""she's a loose-limbed revelation as a pretty-but-normal-looking woman who just can't take things seriously enough to pull her life together.""

It was followed by her appearance in Morten Tyldum's historical drama ''The Imitation Game'' a film based on the British mathematician Alan Turing (played by Benedict Cumberbatch). Knightley portrayed cryptanalyst and numismatist Joan Clarke who decrypted German intelligence codes for the British government during World War II with Turing. ''The Imitation Game'' became a critical and commercial success grossing over $233.6 million. For her performance Knightley received her second Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Though Lady Jean Forde who worked with Clarke and Turing at that time felt Knightley was ""too beautiful"" to play Clarke and said: ""She Clarke was nothing like Keira"".

Knightley's sole release of 2015 was as part of the ensemble cast in the biographical disaster film ''Everest''. The film was based on the 1996 Mount Everest disaster with Knightley portraying mountaineer Rob Hall's wife. ''Everest'' opened to mixed review from critics. In October 2015 Knightley made her Broadway debut playing the title role in Helen Edmundson's adaptation of Émile Zola's ''Thérèse Raquin'' at Studio 54. Her performance received positive reviews. Alexandra Villarreal of ''The Huffington Post'' wrote: ""She fumes and rages and withdraws and you can watch her psychological evolution from stifled wife to impassioned mistress to haunted murderer"". Knightley then starred in the ensemble drama ''Collateral Beauty'' (2016) alongside Will Smith Edward Norton Helen Mirren and Kate Winslet. The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews  and earned the cast a Razzie nomination.

Despite previously stating on a number of occasions that she would never return to the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' film series Knightley reprised her role of Elizabeth Swann with a cameo appearance in 2017's ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales''.

Knightley will produce and star in an adaptation of ''The Other Typist'' by Suzanne Rindell. She will also play the title role in a biopic of French author Colette directed by Wash Westmoreland and star in a biopic of Catherine the Great directed by Barbara Streisand. In 2016 it was announced that Knightley will play the Sugar Plum Fairy in an adaptation of ''The Nutcracker'' titled ''The Nutcracker and the Four Realms'' directed by Lasse Hallström. Knightley is set to star alongside Alexander Skarsgård in ''The Aftermath'' a film adaption of the novel by Rhidian Brook.

===Ancient times===
Archaeological researchers have revealed that a funerary and cult center at Kfar HaHoresh about two miles () from current Nazareth dates back roughly 9000 years to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B era. The remains of some 65 individuals were found buried under huge horizontal headstone structures some of which consisted of up to 3 tons of locally produced white plaster. Decorated human skulls uncovered there have led archaeologists to identify Kfar HaHoresh as a major cult centre in that era.

In 1620 the Catholic Church purchased an area in the Nazareth basin measuring approximately  on the side of the hill known as the Nebi Sa'in. The Franciscan priest Bellarmino Bagatti ""Director of Christian Archaeology"" carried out extensive excavation of this ""Venerated Area"" from 1955 to 1965. Fr. Bagatti uncovered pottery dating from the Middle Bronze Age (2200 to 1500 BC) and ceramics silos and grinding mills from the Iron Age (1500 to 586 BC) which indicated substantial settlement in the Nazareth basin at that time. However lack of archaeological evidence for Nazareth from Assyrian Babylonian Persian Hellenistic or Early Roman times at least in the major excavations between 1955 and 1990 shows that the settlement apparently came to an abrupt end about 720 BC when the Assyrians destroyed many towns in the area.

===Roman Empire era===
Historic photo of Mary's Well
According to the Gospel of Luke Nazareth was the home village of Mary as well as the site of the Annunciation (when the angel Gabriel informed Mary that she would give birth to Jesus). According to the Gospel of Matthew Joseph and Mary resettled in Nazareth after returning from the flight from Bethlehem to Egypt.  According to the Bible Jesus grew up in Nazareth from some point in his childhood. However some modern scholars also regard Nazareth as the birthplace of Jesus.

The Basilica of the Annunciation
James F. Strange an American archaeologist notes: ""Nazareth is not mentioned in ancient Jewish sources earlier than the third century CE. This likely reflects its lack of prominence both in Galilee and in Judaea."" Strange originally calculated the population of Nazareth at the time of Christ as ""roughly 1600 to 2000 people"" but in a subsequent publication revised this figure down to ""a maximum of about 480."" In 2009 Israeli archaeologist Yardenna Alexandre excavated archaeological remains in Nazareth that date to the time of Jesus in the early Roman period. Alexandre told reporters ""The discovery is of the utmost importance since it reveals for the very first time a house from the Jewish village of Nazareth."" 

Other sources state that during Jesus' time Nazareth had a population of 400 and one public bath which was important for civic and religious purposes. However of the artifacts uncovered from the area of the bathhouse and dated by historians or by using radiocarbon dating none are known to predate the 2nd century AD.

The Gospel of Luke says; ""And they led Jesus to the brow of the hill on which their city was built that they might throw him down headlong"". From the ninth century CE and probably earlier tradition associated Christ's evasion of the attempt on his life to the 'Hill of the Leap' (''Jabal al-Qafza'') overlooking the Jezreel Plain some  south of Nazareth.

Crusader-era carving in Nazareth
A tablet at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris dating to 50 CE was sent from Nazareth to Paris in 1878. It contains an inscription known as the ""Ordinance of Caesar"" that outlines the penalty of death for those who violate tombs or graves. However it is suspected that this inscription came to Nazareth from somewhere else (possibly Sepphoris). Bagatti writes: ""we are not certain that it was found in Nazareth even though it came from Nazareth to Paris. At Nazareth there lived various vendors of antiquities who got ancient material from several places."" C. Kopp is more definite: ""It must be accepted with certainty that the Ordinance of Caesar… was brought to the Nazareth market by outside merchants."" Princeton University archaeologist Jack Finnegan describes additional archaeological evidence related to settlement in the Nazareth basin during the Bronze and Iron Ages and states that ""Nazareth was a strongly Jewish settlement in the Roman period.""

Nazareth 1842
Epiphanius in his ''Panarion'' (c. 375 CE) numbers Nazareth among the cities devoid of a non-Jewish population. Epiphanius writing of Joseph of Tiberias a wealthy Roman Jew who converted to Christianity in the time of Constantine says he claimed to have received an imperial rescript to build Christian churches in Jewish towns and villages where no gentiles or Samaritans dwell naming Tiberias Diocaesarea Sepphoris Nazareth and Capernaum. From this scarce notice it has been concluded that a small church which encompassed a cave complex might have been located in Nazareth in the early 4th century"" although the town was Jewish until the 7th century CE.

Although it is mentioned in the New Testament gospels there are no extant non-biblical references to Nazareth until around 200 CE when Sextus Julius Africanus cited by Eusebius (''Church History'' 1.7.14) speaks of Nazara as a village in Judea and locates it near an as-yet unidentified ""Cochaba"". In the same passage Africanus writes of ''desposunoi'' – relatives of Jesus – who he claims ''kept the records of their descent with great care''. A few authors have argued that the absence of 1st and 2nd century CE textual references to Nazareth suggests that the town may not have been inhabited in Jesus' day. Proponents of this hypothesis have buttressed their case with linguistic literary and archaeological interpretations though one writer called that view ""archaeologically unsupportable"".

A Hebrew inscription found in Caesarea dating to the late 3rd or early 4th century mentions Nazareth as the home of the priestly Hapizzez family after the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–135 AD). From the three fragments that have been found the inscription seems to be a list of the twenty-four priestly courses (cf. 1 Chronicles 24:7–19; Nehemiah 11;12) with each course (or family) assigned its proper order and the name of each town or village in Galilee where it settled. Nazareth is not spelled with the ""z"" sound but with the Hebrew tsade (thus ""Nasareth"" or ""Natsareth""). Eleazar Kalir (a Hebrew Galilean poet variously dated from the 6th to 10th century) mentions a locality clearly in the Nazareth region bearing the name Nazareth נצרת (in this case vocalized ""Nitzrat"") which was home to the descendants of the 18th Kohen family Happitzetz (הפצץ) for at least several centuries after the Bar Kochva revolt.

===Byzantine period===
In the 6th century religious narrations from local Christians about the Virgin Mary began to spark interest in the site among pilgrims who founded the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation at the site of a freshwater spring today known as Mary's Well. Around 570 the Anonymous of Piacenza reports travelling from Sepphoris to Nazareth. There he records seeing at the Jewish synagogue the books where Jesus learnt his letters and a bench where he sat. According to him Christians could lift it but Jews could not since it disallowed them from dragging it outside. Writing of the beauty of the Hebrew women there he records them saying St. Mary was a relative of theirs and notes that ""The house of St. Mary is a basilica.""

The Catholic writer Jerome writing in the 5th century says Nazareth was a ''viculus'' or mere village. The Jewish town profited from the Christian pilgrim trade which began in the 4th century but latent anti-Christian hostility broke out in 614 AD when the Persians invaded Palestine. The Christian Byzantine author Eutychius claimed that Jewish people of Nazareth helped the Persians carry out their slaughter of the Christians. When the Byzantine or Eastern Roman emperor Heraclius ejected the Persians in 630 AD he expelled the city's Jews.

===Crusades===
Makam al-Nabi Sain Mosque of Nazareth
In 1099 the Crusader Tancred captured Galilee and established his capital in Nazareth. The ancient diocese of Scythopolis was also relocated under the Archbishop of Nazareth one of the four archdioceses in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The town returned to Muslim control in 1187 following the victory of Saladin in the Battle of Hattin. The remaining Crusaders and European clergy were forced to leave town. Frederick II managed to negotiate safe passage for pilgrims from Acre in 1229 and in 1251 Louis IX the king of France attended mass in the grotto accompanied by his wife.

===Mamluk rule===
In 1263 Baybars the Mamluk Sultan destroyed the Christian buildings in Nazareth and declared the site off-limits to Latin clergy as part of his bid to drive out the remaining Crusaders from Palestine. While Arab Christian families continued to live in Nazareth its status was reduced to that of a poor village. Pilgrims who visited the site in 1294 reported only a small church protecting the grotto.

===Ottoman era===
In the 14th century Franciscan monks were permitted to return and live within the ruins of the Basilica but they were evicted again in 1584. In 1620 Fakhr-al-Din II a Druze emir who controlled this part of Ottoman Syria permitted them to build a small church at the Grotto of the Annunciation. Pilgrimage tours to surrounding sacred sites were organized by the Franciscans but the monks suffered harassment from surrounding Bedouin tribes who often kidnapped them for ransom.

Stability returned with the rule of Zahir al-Umar a powerful Arab sheikh who ruled the Galilee and later much of the Levantine coast and Palestine. He transformed Nazareth from a minor village into a large town by encouraging immigration to it. Nazareth played a strategic role in Zahir's sheikhdom because it allowed him to wield control over the agricultural areas of central Galilee. He made sure to ensure Nazareth's security for other reasons as well among them strengthening ties with France by protecting the Christian community and to protect one of his wives who resided in Nazareth.

Zahir authorized the Franciscans to build a church in 1730. That structure stood until 1955 when it was demolished to make way for a larger building completed in 1967. He also permitted the Franciscans to purchase the Synagogue Church in 1741 and authorized the Greek Orthodox community to build St. Gabriel's Church in 1767. Zahir commissioned the construction of a government house known as the Seraya which served as the city's municipal headquarters until 1991. His descendants—known as the ""Dhawahri""—along with the Zu'bi Fahum and 'Onassah families later constituted Nazareth's traditional Muslim elite.

Nazareth's Christian community did not fare well under Zahir's Ottoman successor Jazzar Pasha (r. 1776–1804) and friction increased between its Christians and Muslim peasants from the surrounding villages. Nazareth was temporarily captured by the troops of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799 during his Syrian campaign. Napoleon visited the holy sites and considered appointing his general Jean-Andoche Junot as the duke of Nazareth. During the rule of Governor Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt (1830–1840) over much of Ottoman Syria Nazareth was opened to European missionaries and traders. After the Ottomans regained control European money continued to flow into Nazareth and new institutions were established. The Christians of Nazareth were protected during the massacres of 1860 by Aqil Agha the Bedouin leader who exercised control over the Galilee between 1845 and 1870.

Kaloost Vartan an Armenian from Istanbul arrived in 1864 and established the first medical mission in Nazareth the Scottish ""hospital on the hill"" or the Nazareth Hospital as it is known today with sponsorship from the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society. The Ottoman Sultan who favored the French allowed them to establish an orphanage the Society of Saint Francis de Sale. By the late 19th century Nazareth was a town with a strong Arab Christian presence and a growing European community where a number of communal projects were undertaken and new religious buildings were erected. In 1871  Christ Church the city's only Anglican church was completed under the leadership of the Rev John Zeller and consecrated by Bishop Samuel Gobat.

In the late 19th century and the first years of the 20th century Nazareth prospered as it served the role of a market center for the dozens of rural Arab villages located within its vicinity. Local peasants would purchase supplies from Nazareth's many ''souks'' (open-air markets) which included separate ''souks'' for agricultural produce metalwork jewelry and leathers. In 1914 Nazareth consisted of eight quarters: 'Araq Farah Jami' Khanuq Maidan Mazazwa Sharqiya and Shufani. There were nine churches two monasteries four convents two mosques four hospitals four private schools a public school a police station three orphanages a hotel three inns a flour mill and eight ''souks''. The Ottomans lost control of Palestine including Nazareth to the Allied Powers during World War I. By then Nazareth's importance declined significantly as most of the Arab villages in the Jezreel Valley had been replaced by newly established Jewish communities.

===British Mandate period===
Fountain of the Virgin 1891
The United Kingdom gained control of Palestine in 1917 the same year of the Balfour Declaration which promised British support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. In the years preceding and following the declaration Jewish immigration to Palestine had been increasing. Representatives of Nazareth opposed the Zionist movement sending a delegation to the 1919 First Palestine Arab Congress and issuing a letter of protest in 1920 that condemned the movement while also proclaiming solidarity with the Jews of Palestine. Politically Nazareth was becoming further involved in the growing Palestinian nationalist movement. In 1922 a Muslim-Christian Association was established in the town largely sponsored by the Muslim al-Zu'bi family. A consistent and effective united Palestinian Arab religious front proved difficult to establish and alternative organizations such as the Supreme Muslim Council's Organization of Muslim Youth and the National Muslim Association were established in Nazareth later in the 1920s.in 1922 there had been a small population of 58 Jews and Jewish families living in Nazareth. and were a ancient community 

Nazareth was relatively slow to modernize. While other towns already had wired electricity Nazareth delayed its electrification until the 1930s and invested instead in improving its water supply system. This included adding two reservoirs at the northwestern hills and several new cisterns. By 1930 a church for the Baptist denomination a municipal garden at Mary's Well and a police station based in Zahir al-Umar's Seraya had been established and the Muslim Sharqiya Quarter had expanded.

In the 1935-1939 Arab Revolt Nazareth played a minor role contributing two rebel commanders out of 281 rebel commanders active in the country. The two were Nazareth native and Christian Fu'ad Nassar and Nazareth resident and Indur native Tawfiq al-Ibrahim. The nearby villages of Saffuriya and al-Mujaydil played a more active military role contributing nine commanders between them. The leaders of the revolt sought to use Nazareth as a staging ground to protest the British proposal to include the Galilee into a future Jewish state. On 26 September 1937 the British district commissioner of the Galilee Lewis Yelland Andrews was assassinated in Nazareth by local rebels.

By 1946 the municipal boundary of Nazareth had been enlarged and new neighborhoods namely Maidan Maslakh Khanuq and Nimsawi were established. New homes were established in existing quarters and the town still had an abundance of orchards and agricultural fields. Two cigarette factories a tobacco store two cinemas and a tile factory had been established significantly boosting Nazareth's economy. A new police station was built on Nazareth's southernmost hill while the police station in the Seray had been converted into Nazareth's municipal headquarters. Watchtowers were also erected on some of the hilltops around the town. Other new or expanded government offices included a headquarters for the district commissioner at the former Ottoman military barracks and offices for the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Survey and Settlement.

Nazareth was in the territory allotted to the Arab state under the 1947 UN Partition Plan. In the months leading up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the town became a refuge for Palestinians fleeing the urban centers of Tiberias Haifa and Baysan before and during the Haganah's capture of those cities on 18 April 22 April and 12 May 1948 respectively.

===Israeli period===

====1948 War====
Amin Gargurah (left) Mayor of Nazareth with Israeli prime minister Moshe Sharett 1955
Nazareth itself was not a field of battle during the 1948 War which began on 15 May before the first truce on 11 June although some of the villagers had joined the loosely organized peasant military and paramilitary forces and troops from the Arab Liberation Army (ALA) had entered Nazareth on 9 July. The local defense of the town consisted of 200–300 militiamen distributed along the hills surrounding the town. The defense in the southern and western hills collapsed after Israeli shelling while resistance in the northern hills had to contend with an incoming Israeli armored unit. Not long after the Israelis began shelling the local militiamen Nazareth's police chief raised a white flag over the town's police station.

Most of the fighting around Nazareth occurred in its satellite villages particularly in Saffuriya whose residents put up resistance until largely dispersing following Israeli air raids on 15 July. During the ten days of fighting which occurred between the first and second truce Nazareth capitulated to Israeli troops during Operation Dekel on 16 July after little more than token resistance. By then morale among local militiamen was low and most refused to fight alongside the ALA because of their perceived weakness in the face of Israel's perceived military superiority and the alleged maltreatment of Christian residents and clergy by ALA volunteers. The Muslim mayor of Nazareth Yusef Fahum requested a halt to all resistance put up by Nazarenes to prevent the town's destruction.

The surrender of Nazareth was formalized in a written agreement whereby the town's leaders agreed to cease hostilities in return for promises from the Israeli officers including brigade commander Ben Dunkelman (the leader of the operation) that no harm would come to the civilians of the town. Soon after the signing of the agreement Dunkelman received an order from the Israeli General Chaim Laskov to forcibly evacuate the city's Arabs. He refused remarking that he was ‘shocked and horrified’ that he would be commanded to renege on the agreement he and also Chaim Laskov had just signed. Twelve hours after defying his superior he was relieved of his post but not before obtaining assurances that the security of Nazareth's population would be guaranteed. David Ben-Gurion backed his judgement up fearing that expelling Christian Arabs might provoke an outcry throughout the Christian world. By the end of the war Nazareth's population saw a large influx of refugees from major urban centers and rural villages in the Galilee.

====1950s-1960s====
In the first few years of its incorporation into Israel Nazareth's affairs were dominated by the issues of land confiscation internally displaced refugees and the hardships of martial law which included curfews and travel restrictions. Efforts to resolve these issues were largely unsuccessful and led to frustration among the inhabitants which in turn contributed to political agitation in the city. As the largest Arab town in Israel Nazareth became a center of Arab and Palestinian nationalism and because the Communist Party was the sole legal political group that took up many of the local Arab causes it gained popularity in Nazareth. Arab political organization within Nazareth and Israel was largely stymied by the state until recent decades. Arab and Palestinian nationalist sentiment continue to influence Nazareth's political life.

In 1954 1200 dunams of Nazareth's land which had been slated for future urban expansion by the municipality was confiscated by state authorities for the construction of government offices and in 1957 for the construction of the Jewish town of Nazareth Illit. The latter was built as a way for the state to counterbalance the Arab majority in the region. Knesset member Seif el-Din el-Zoubi who represented Nazareth actively opposed the Absentees' Property Law which allowed state confiscation of land from Arab citizens who were not permitted to return to their original villages. Zoubi argued that the internally displaced refugees were not absentees as they were still living in the country as citizens and wanted to return to their homes. Israel offered compensation to these internal refugees but most refused for fear of permanently relinquishing their right of return. Tensions between Nazareth's inhabitants and the state came to a head during a 1958 May Day rally where marchers demanded that refugees be allowed to return to their villages an end to land confiscations and self-determination for Palestinians. Several young protesters were arrested for throwing stones at security forces. Martial law ended in 1966.

On 5 January 1964 Pope Paul VI included Nazareth in the first ever papal visit to the Holy Land.

====1980s–2010s====
View of modern Nazareth

As of the early 1990s no city plans drafted by Nazareth Municipality have been approved by the government (both the British Mandate and later Israel) since 1942. This has left many people in Nazareth who vote in the city's municipal elections and receive services from its municipality effectively outside of the city's jurisdiction. Such areas include the Sharqiya and Jabal el-Daula quarters which are in Nazareth Illit's jurisdiction and whose residents had to acquire building permits from the latter city. Similarly the Bilal neighborhood of the Safafra Quarter is located within Reineh's jurisdiction. In 1993 the residents of Bilal became official residents of Reineh. Nazareth's municipal plans for expansion prior to the establishment of Nazareth Illit were to the north and east areas that the latter city now occupy. Arab satellite towns are closely located to the north west and southwest. Thus the remaining area within the city's municipal boundaries available for expansion were to the northwest and the south where the topography restricted urban development. After lobbying the Knesset and the Interior Ministry el-Zoubi was able to have areas to the northwest of the city annexed to the municipality.

In the 1980s the government began attempts to merge the nearby village of Ilut with Nazareth although this move was opposed by residents from both localities and the Nazareth Municipality. Ilut's residents were included as part of Nazareth's electorate in the 1983 and 1989 municipal elections which Ilut's residents largely boycotted and in the 1988 national elections. Ilut was designated by the Interior Ministry as a separate local council in 1991. The Israeli government has designated a Nazareth metropolitan area that includes the local councils of Yafa an-Naseriyye to the south Reineh Mashhad and Kafr Kanna to the north Iksal and Nazareth Illit to the east and Migdal HaEmek to the west.

Monument to Arab Israeli casualties in the October 2000 events Nazareth
As the political center of Israel's Arab citizens Nazareth is the scene of annual rallies held by the community including Land Day since March 1975 and May Day. There are also frequent demonstrations in support of the Palestinian cause. During the First Intifada (1987–1993) May Day marchers vocally supported the Palestinian uprising. On 22 December 1987 riots broke out during a strike held in solidarity with the Intifada. On 24 January 1988 a mass demonstration attracted between 20000–50000 participants from Nazareth and other Arab towns. On 13 May during a football match in Nahariya a riot broke out between Arab and Jewish fans resulting in a Jewish man being stabbed and 54 people mostly Arabs being arrested. A rally in Nazareth on 19 May followed in which thousands of Arabs protested against ""racist attacks"" against the Arab fans and discriminatory policies against Arabs in general.

Preparations for the Pope's visit to Nazareth in 2000 triggered highly publicized tensions related to the Basilica of the Annunciation. In 1997 permission was granted to construct a paved plaza to handle the thousands of Christian pilgrims expected to arrive. A small group of Muslims protested and occupied the site where a nephew of Saladin named Shihab al-Din is believed to be buried. A school al-Harbyeh had been built on the site by the Ottomans and the Shihab-Eddin shrine along with several shops owned by the waqf were located there. Government approval of plans for a large mosque on the property triggered protests from Christian leaders. In 2002 a special government commission permanently halted construction of the mosque.

In March 2006 public protests followed the disruption of a prayer service by an Israeli Jew and his Christian wife and daughter who detonated firecrackers inside the church. The family said it wanted to draw attention to their problems with the welfare authorities. In July 2006 a rocket fired by Hezbollah as part of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict killed two children in Nazareth.

In March 2010 the Israeli government approved a $3 million plan to develop Nazareth's tourism industry. New businesses receive start-up grants of up to 30 percent of their initial investment from the Ministry of Tourism.

684254,Robert Meeropol,Activism and career,"Robert Meeropol (2009) holding copy of Government Exhibit 8 from the Rosenberg trial the cross-sectional drawing of an atomic bomb which was said to be the ""secret of the atomic bomb"" the Rosenbergs had passed to the Soviet Union.
In the 1960s and 1970s Meeropol became active in the anti-war effort. After completing his master's degree Meeropol taught anthropology at Western New England College in Springfield Massachusetts from 1971 to 1973.

With his brother Meeropol sued the FBI and CIA under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) winning the release of 300000 previously secret documents pertaining to their parents' case.  Believing the documents proved their parents' innocence the Meeropol brothers co-wrote a book about their childhood ''We Are Your Sons: The Legacy of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg'' (1975). From 1974 to 1978 he worked actively with the National Committee to reopen the Rosenberg Case and the Fund for Open Information and Accountability.

From 1980 to 1982 he was managing editor of ''Socialist Review'' in the San Francisco Bay Area. During this time his parents' executioner Joseph Francel died. In 1982 Meeropol moved back to Massachusetts.  He returned to school studying at the Western New England College School of Law from which he received his J.D. degree in 1985.  He was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar and began practice as an attorney.

In 1990 Meeropol started the Rosenberg Fund for Children a public foundation which provides support for children in the U.S. whose parents are targeted progressive activists.  The RFC also supports youth in the U.S. who have been targeted for their own progressive activism. He stepped down from the position of Executive Director of RFC on September 1 2013 to be succeeded by his daughter Jennifer.

He later wrote ''An Execution in the Family: One Son's Journey'' (2003) a memoir that reflected on his life and his parents' fate.

137105,United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1976,Introduction,"


The United Kingdom held a national preselection to choose the song that would go to the Eurovision Song Contest 1976. It took place on 25 February 1976 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. For the first time since 1964 a single act did not perform each of the nominated songs with rather each song being performed by a different act. Michael Aspel acted as presenter for the event.

A Song for Europe was watched in 6.3 million homes (giving it a general viewing figure of 12.6 million viewers) and finishing as the 18th-most watched programme of the week. 

""Save Your Kisses for Me"" won the national final performed on stage with dance moves and four brightly dressed singers it ultimately went on to win the Eurovision Song Contest itself and become a UK No1 single the group had a 3 UK No1 singles including one prior and one after this.

Michael Aspel also provided the television commentary for the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest for BBC 1 Terry Wogan once again provided the radio commentary for BBC Radio 2 listeners and Andrew Pastouna provided commentary for British Forces Radio. Ray Moore acted as spokesperson for the UK Jury results.

The library services of NLB and RNIB were merged on 1 January 2007 to form the RNIB National Library Service. The merged service is part of RNIB and incorporates all the library services formerly provided by the two organisations. NLB continues to exist only as a 'shell charity' for the purposes of receiving donations and legacies.

In November 2012 NLB's Bredbury site was closed and its braille giant print and Moon books and braille sheet music collections were re-located from to the RNIB's Peterborough site.

Some former NLB staff were re-located to an office in Stockport town centre where they continue to provide advice and support to readers. The building at Far Cromwell Road Bredbury was sold in late 2012 to an online retailer to serve as their office/warehouse facility.

"
12764,Roman calendar,Introduction,"


A reproduction of the fragmentary ''''  with the seventh and eighth months still named Quintilis (""QVI"") and Sextilis (""SEX"") and an intercalary month (""INTER"") in the far righthand column
Another reproduction of the ''''
The '''Roman calendar''' is the calendar used by the Roman kingdom and republic. It is often inclusive of the Julian calendar established by the reforms of the dictator Julius Caesar and emperor Augustus in the late 1stcentury and sometimes inclusive of any system dated by inclusive counting towards months' kalends nones and ides in the Roman manner. It is usually exclusive of the Alexandrian calendar of Roman Egypt which continued the unique months of that land's former calendar; the Byzantine calendar of the later Roman Empire which usually dated the Roman months in the simple count of the ancient Greek calendars; and the Gregorian calendar which refined the Julian system to bring it into still closer alignment with the solar year and is the basis of the current international standard.

Roman dates were counted inclusively forward to the next of three principal days: the first of the month (the kalends) a day less than the middle of the month (the ides) and eight days—nine counting inclusively—before this (the nones). The original calendar consisted of 10 months beginning in spring with March; winter was left as an unassigned span of days. These months ran for 38 nundinal cycles each forming a kind of eight (i.e. ""nine"") day week ended by religious rituals and a public market. The winter period was then used to create January and February. The legendary early kings Romulus and Numa were traditionally credited with establishing this early fixed calendar which bears traces of its origin as an observational lunar one. In particular the kalends nones and ides seem to have derived from the first sighting of the crescent moon the first-quarter moon and the full moon respectively. The system ran well short of the solar year and it needed constant intercalation to keep religious festivals and other activities in their proper seasons. For superstitious reasons such intercalation occurred within the month of February even after it was no longer considered the last month.

After the establishment of the Roman Republic years began to be dated by consulships and control over intercalation was granted to the pontifices who eventually abused their power by lengthening years controlled by their political allies and shortening the years in their rivals' terms of office. Having won his war with Pompey Caesar used his position as Rome's chief pontiff to enact a calendar reform in 46 coincidentally making the year of his third consulship last for 446 days. In order to avoid interfering with Rome's religious ceremonies the reform added all its days towards the ends of months and did not adjust any nones or ides even in months which came to have 31 days. The Julian calendar was supposed to have a single leap day on 24 February (a doubled '''') every fourth year but following Caesar's assassination the priests figured this using inclusive counting and mistakenly added the bissextile day every three years. In order to bring the calendar back to its proper place Augustus was obliged to suspend intercalation for a few decades. The revised calendar remaining slightly longer than the solar year the date of Easter shifted far enough away from the vernal equinox that Pope Gregory XIII ordered its adjustment in the 16th century.

142475,John Barleycorn,Recordings and modern performances,"Many versions of the song have been recorded including a very popular version by the rock group Traffic appearing on their 1970 album ''John Barleycorn Must Die''. The song has also been recorded by Fire + Ice Gae Bolg Bert Jansch the John Renbourn Group Pentangle Finest Kind Martin Carthy Roy Bailey Martyn Bates in collaboration with Max Eastley the Watersons Steeleye Span Jethro Tull Joe Walsh Steve Winwood

Billy Bragg sang in Weller's place on live performances. Rock guitarist Joe Walsh performed the song live in 2007 as a tribute to Jim Capaldi. Lithuanian folk-blues band Working Hobo performs this song in Lithuanian which is called Džonas Miežis.
"
51871,Emerald Lake Hills California,After the war,"Within a few years of the end of World War II Emerald Hills was making the transition from a vacation resort to a residential area albeit a rustic one. The Emerald Lake Homeowners Association was established in the 1950s to contest the planned routing of an interstate highway through the neighborhood. (Completed in the early 1970s Interstate 280 runs west of Emerald Hills sticking close to the San Andreas Fault.) In the adjacent Farm Hill subdivision—part of Redwood City—kids discovered mercury in 1955 on the property of Andy Oddstad. The mercury market was not as vigorous however as it was in the years when the New Almaden Quicksilver Mine was a major industry in San Jose; the most visible result of the Farm Hill discovery today is a street named Silver Hill.

In 1968 Emerald Hills had 430 families of which 110 about 25 percent had resided there less than a year and 180 from one to nine years; four years later the newcomer rate had dropped to 10 percent. Also near the lake was a convent occupied by Franciscan sisters from 1967–70; the order then built a large compound Mount Alverno adjacent to the Elks golf course. In 2008 it was sold to the Buddhist order Shinnyo-en which currently uses it as their U.S. Head Temple.

A survey of homeowners at this time showed that having staved off the interstate threat they were most concerned with keeping the neighborhood's rustic nature. On the whole they opposed annexation to Redwood City and supported bigger lot sizes for a maximum of 1400 homes in the area more trails and preservation of the lakes and two unique features the Easter Cross and Handley's Rock. At the time a large parcel adjacent to the proposed freeway at the community's northern edge was being considered for a possible Cal State campus. That plan was abandoned and because the presence of a little butterfly called the bay checkerspot helped lead to the defeat of attempts to build a golf course there the land is now Edgewood County Park.

1355,AIM-54 Phoenix,Usage in comparison to other weapon systems,"The AIM-54/AWG-9 combination had multiple track capability (up to 24 targets) and launch (up to 6 Phoenixes can be launched nearly simultaneously); the large  missile is equipped with a conventional warhead.

On the F-14 four missiles can be carried under the fuselage tunnel attached to special aerodynamic pallets plus two under glove stations. A full load of 6 Phoenix missiles and the unique launch rails weighs in at over  about twice the weight of Sparrows so it was more common to carry a mixed load of 4 Phoenix 2 Sparrow and 2 Sidewinder missiles.

Most other US aircraft relied on the smaller semi-active medium-range AIM-7 Sparrow. Semi-active guidance meant the aircraft no longer had a search capability while supporting the launched Sparrow reducing situational awareness.

The Tomcat's radar could track up to 24 targets in track-while-scan mode with the AWG-9 selecting up to 6 potential targets for the missiles. The pilot or radar intercept officer (RIO) could then launch the Phoenix missiles once parameters were met. The large tactical information display (TID) in the RIO's cockpit gave information to the aircrew (the pilot had the ability to monitor the RIO's display) and the radar could continually search and track multiple targets after Phoenix missiles were launched thereby maintaining situational awareness of the battlespace.

The Link-4 datalink allowed US Navy Tomcats to share information with the E-2C Hawkeye AEW aircraft. During Desert Shield in 1990 the Link-4A was introduced; this allowed the Tomcats to have a fighter-to-fighter datalink capability further enhancing overall situational awareness. The F-14D entered service with the JTIDS that brought the even better Link-16 datalink ""picture"" to the cockpit.

===Active guidance===
AIM-54 Phoenix seconds after launch (1991)
The Phoenix has several guidance modes and achieves its longest range by using mid-course updates from the F-14A/B AWG-9 radar (APG-71 radar in the F-14D) as it climbs to cruise between  and  at close to Mach 5. Phoenix uses this high altitude to gain gravitational potential energy which is later converted into kinetic energy as the missile dives at high velocity towards its target. At around  from the target the missile activates its own radar to provide terminal guidance. Minimum engagement range for the Phoenix is around  and active homing would initiate upon launch.

11304,Position (poker),Texas hold 'em example,"360px
There are 10 players playing $4/$8 fixed limit. Alice pays the $2 small blind. Bob pays the $4 big blind. Carol is under the gun (first to act). If Carol has a hand like K♥ J♠ she may choose to fold. With 9 opponents remaining to act there is approximately a 40% chance that at least one of them will have a better hand than Carol's like A-A K-K Q-Q J-J A-K A-Q A-J or K-Q. And even if no one does seven of them (all but the two players in the blind) will have position on Carol in the next three betting rounds.

Now instead suppose David in the cut-off position (to the right of the button) has the same K♥ J♠ and all players fold to him. In this situation there are only three opponents left to act so the odds that one of them has a better hand are considerably less (only around 16%). Secondly two of those three (Alice and Bob) will be out of position to David on later betting rounds. A common play would be for David to raise and hope that the button (the only player who has position on David) folds. David's raise might simply steal the blinds if they don't have playable hands but if they do play David will be in good shape to take advantage of his position in later betting rounds.

453957,Avraham Ben-Yitzhak,Introduction,"'''Avraham Ben-Yitzhak''' (; 1883 – 1950) was an Israeli Hebrew poet.

He was born Avraham Sonne on September 13 1883 in Przemyśl Austrian Galicia a region of Eastern Europe which has changed hands throughout history between Austria and Poland. In his youth Przemyśl was part of the Austrian Empire and he moved to Vienna to study. In 1938 he fled to the British Mandate of Palestine after the German occupation of Vienna. He died in 1950 in Israel of tuberculosis. He had only published eleven poems in his lifetime. These and a few more were rediscovered after his death.

He was a friend of Elias Canetti who met him in 1933. Canetti describes ""Dr. Sonne"" in his autobiographical book Das Augenspiel (''The Play of the Eyes''). In his description Avraham Ben-Yitzhak appears as a profound scholar with interests in religion philosophy psychology and sociology. Dr. Sonne had a lasting influence on Canetti who later wrote a profile of him in the April 7 1986 edition of The New Yorker. He was also a friend of James Joyce and rumored to be romantically attached to Leah Goldberg. Most of all and especially in his later years his friends remembered him for his long silences.

===''The IPCRESS File''===

On-set during filming of ''The IPCRESS File'' Len Deighton teaches Michael Caine how to break an egg. 
''The IPCRESS File'' novel came out just after the release of the first James Bond film ''Dr. No'' (1962). When the novel sold well Eon producers Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli approached Deighton to write the script for the next 007 film ''From Russia With Love'' (1963); despite Deighton's efforts little of his screenplay was filmed. Saltzman instead decided to use ''The IPCRESS File'' and its sequels as the beginning of a new secret agent movie series. Unlike the Bond films ''The IPCRESS File'' was designed to have a different more down-beat style although Saltzman employed many Bond movie staff including production designer Ken Adam editor Peter Hunt and composer John Barry. Michael Caine was chosen to play the lead.

In the film version Harry Palmer is a British army sergeant forcibly drafted into the security services to work away a prison sentence for black marketeering. He worked first for Army Intelligence then the Foreign Office. He works for the brilliant but slightly duplicitous Colonel Ross. Harry Palmer has much in common with Deighton including passions for military history (Harvey Newbegin complains about his bookshelf contents in ''Billion Dollar Brain'') cooking and classical music.

=== Sequels ===
After the release of ''The IPCRESS File'' in 1965 Saltzman's production company made ''Funeral in Berlin'' (1966) and ''Billion Dollar Brain'' (1967) both starring Michael Caine. The second Harry Palmer novel ''Horse Under Water'' was not used. In 1976 Deighton's novel ''Spy Story'' was filmed with Michael Petrovitch as 'Patrick Armstrong'; it is unrelated to Saltzman's Harry Palmer films.

In the mid-1990s there appeared two Harry Palmer films with original screenplays and starring Michael Caine: ''Bullet to Beijing'' (1995) and ''Midnight in Saint Petersburg'' (1996). Despite sometimes being titled ''Len Deighton's Bullet to Beijing'' and ''Len Deighton's Midnight in St Petersburg'' Deighton did not participate in these films.

=== Allusions ===
Evidence of Michael Caine's popular identification as Harry Palmer can be seen in movies such as ''Blue Ice'' (1992) where he plays an ex-spy named 'Harry' and who has many similarities to Harry Palmer.

In ''Austin Powers in Goldmember'' (2002) Caine's portrayal of Nigel Powers father of secret agent Austin Powers spoofs Harry Palmer.

In ''Kingsman: The Secret Service'' (2014) Caine portrays the bespectacled head of a secret espionage unit.

117628,Blight,Introduction,"

'''Blight''' refers to a specific symptom affecting plants in response to infection by a pathogenic organism.  It is a rapid and complete chlorosis browning then death of plant tissues such as leaves branches twigs or floral organs.  Accordingly many diseases that primarily exhibit this symptom are called blights. Several notable examples are:
* Late blight of potato caused by the water mold ''Phytophthora infestans'' (Mont.) de Bary the disease which led to the Great Irish Famine
* Southern corn leaf blight caused by the fungus ''Cochliobolus heterostrophus'' (Drechs.) Drechs anamorph ''Bipolaris maydis'' (Nisikado & Miyake) Shoemaker incited a severe loss of corn in the United States in 1970.
* Chestnut blight caused by the fungus ''Cryphonectria parasitica'' (Murrill) Barr has nearly completely eradicated mature American chestnuts in North America.
* Fire blight of pome fruits caused by the bacterium ''Erwinia amylovora'' (Burrill) Winslow ''et al.'' is the most severe disease of pear and also is found in apple and raspberry among others.
* Bacterial leaf blight of rice caused by the bacterium ''Xanthomonas oryzae'' (Uyeda & Ishiyama) Dowson.
* Early blight of potato and tomato caused by species of the ubiquitous fungal genus ''Alternaria''
*Leaf blight of the grasses 

On leaf tissue symptoms of blight are the initial appearance of lesions which rapidly engulf surrounding tissue. However leaf spot may in advanced stages expand to kill entire areas of leaf tissue and thus exhibit blight symptoms.

Blights are often named after their causative agent for example Colletotrichum blight is named after the fungi ''Colletotrichum capsici'' and Phytophthora blight is named after the water mold ''Phytophthora parasitica''.

761222,Drum (2004 film),Introduction,"
'''''Drum''''' is a 2004 film based on the life of South African investigative journalist Henry Nxumalo who worked for ''Drum'' magazine called ""the first black lifestyle magazine in Africa"". It was director Zola Maseko's first film and deals with the issues of apartheid and the forced removal of residents from Sophiatown. The film was originally to be a six-part television series called ''Sophiatown Short Stories'' but Maseko could not get the funding. The lead roles of Henry Nxumalo and ''Drum'' main photographer Jürgen Schadeberg were played by American actors Taye Diggs and Gabriel Mann while most of the rest of the cast were South African actors.

The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2004 and did the rounds of international film festivals before going on general release in South Africa in July 2006. It was released in Europe but failed to get a distributor for the USA where it went straight to DVD.

The film was generally well received critically. Most of the negative reviews were based on the quality of Maseko's directing and Jason Filardi's screenwriting. It was awarded Best South African Film at the Durban International Film Festival and director Maseko gained the top prize at the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO).

216165,Sender Policy Framework,Controversy,"

In 2004 Steven M. Bellovin wrote an e-mail discussing his concerns with SPF. Some of these include:
* SPF originally used TXT records in DNS which are supposed to be free-form text with no semantics attached.  SPF proponents readily acknowledge that it would be better to have records specifically designated for SPF but this choice was made to enable rapid implementation of SPF.  In July 2005 IANA assigned the Resource Record type 99 to SPF.  Later on the use of SPF records was discontinued and  it is still necessary to use TXT records.
* At the time he wrote his message there was no consensus that SPF was the right way to go.  Some major e-mail service providers have not bought into this scheme.  Unless and until they do it does not help much either for their customers (who make up a substantial proportion of the user population) or for everyone else (because their addresses could be forged).  It is worth noting that since this concern was raised Google Mail and AOL among others have embraced SPF.
* Bellovin's strongest concerns involve the underlying assumptions of SPF (its ""semantic model"").  When using SPF the SPF DNS records determine how a sender is allowed to send meaning that the owner of the domain will control how senders are allowed to send. People who use ""portable"" e-mail addresses (such as e-mail addresses created by professional organizations) will be required to use the domain owner's SMTP sender which may not even exist. Organizations providing these ""portable"" addresses could however create their own mail submission agents (MSAs) (RFC 6409) or offer VPNs or simply not publish an SPF record. Additionally SPF only ties the SMTP Return-Path to permitted MSAs; users are still free to use their RFC 5322 addresses elsewhere.

There are other concerns about the impact of widespread use of SPF notably the impact on various legitimate forms of email spoofing such as forwarding services SMTP use by people with multiple identities etc.  (For example a person who uses their home ISP's SMTP servers to send mail with their work email as the address.) On the other hand many of these uses may be ""expected"" yet not ""legitimate"". To a certain extent this is more a question of ownership and expectations than a technical question.

The IETF spfbis working group tasked with reworking the SPF specification aiming for ""Proposed Standard"" status in a new RFC during April 2013 appeared to have reached consensus around deprecating SPF type 99 in favour of continued TXT record usage. People from the DNSEXT working group strongly opposed this in a series of email threads on spfbis dnsext and IETF general discussion mailing lists. The spfbis working group chair requested an end to that torrent of protest since the discussion on the resource record type (RRTYPE) in the working group was terminated long ago a move that was seen as trying to silence the protests by some fierce DNS purists. An independent draft was proposed later documenting how the spurious recursion to TXT records is characterized in the current Internet.

107329,Stoke City F.C.,History,"


===Formation and the early years===
Graph showing Stoke City F.C.'s progress through the English football league system form 1889 to the present
'''Stoke City F.C.''' was formed in 1863 under the name '''Stoke Ramblers''' when pupils of Charterhouse School formed a football club while they were apprentices at the North Staffordshire Railway works in Stoke-upon-Trent. The club's first documented match was in October 1868 against an EW May XV at the Victoria Cricket Club ground. Henry Almond the club's founder was also captain and scored the club's first ever goal. During this period they played at the Victoria Cricket Ground; however they switched to a nearby ground at Sweetings Field in 1875 to cope with rising attendances.

The Stoke team of 1877–78.
In 1878 the club merged with Stoke Victoria Cricket Club and became '''Stoke Football Club'''. They moved from their previous ground Sweetings Field to the Athletic Club ground which soon became known as the Victoria Ground. It was around this time that the club adopted their traditional red-and-white striped kit. In August 1885 the club turned professional.

Stoke were one of the twelve founding members of the Football League when it was introduced in 1888. The club struggled in their first two seasons 1888–89 and 1889–90 finishing bottom on both occasions. In 1890 Stoke failed to be re-elected and joined the Football Alliance which they won and thus were re-elected to the Football League. Stoke spent the next 15 seasons in the First Division and reached the FA Cup Semi-Final in the 1898–99 season before being relegated in 1907. Stoke went bankrupt and entered non-league football until 1914 when the First World War meant the Football League was suspended for four years. During the wartime period Stoke entered the Lancashire Primary and Secondary leagues. When football recommenced in August 1919 Stoke re-joined the league.

===Victoria Ground and Stanley Matthews===

The club became owners of the Victoria Ground in 1919. This was followed by the construction of the Butler Street stand which increased the overall capacity of the ground to 50000. In 1925 Stoke-on-Trent was granted ""city status"" and this led the club to change its name to '''Stoke City F.C.'''

The 1930s saw the debut of club's most celebrated player Stanley Matthews. Matthews who grew up in Hanley was an apprentice at the club and made his first appearance in March 1932 against Bury at the age of 17. By end of the decade Matthews had established himself as an England international and as one of the best footballers of his generation. Stoke achieved promotion from the Second Division in 1932–33 – as champions – however Matthews only featured in fifteen games in this season. He did however score his first goal for the club in a 3–1 win against local rivals Port Vale.

By 1934 the club's average attendance had risen to over 23000 which in turn allowed the club to give the manager Tom Mather increased transfer funds. The club was now considered one of the top teams in the country. It was in this period that the club recorded its record league win a 10–3 win over West Bromwich Albion in February 1937. In April of that year the club achieved its record league crowd – 51373 against Arsenal. Freddie Steele's 33 league goals in the 1936–37 season remains a club record.

===Title challenge and league decline===
Following the resumption of the FA Cup after World War II tragedy struck on 9 March 1946 as 33 fans died and 520 were injured during a 6th round tie away against Bolton Wanderers. This came known as the Burnden Park disaster. In 1946–47 Stoke mounted a serious title challenge. The club needed a win in their final game of the season to win the First Division title. However a 2–1 defeat to Sheffield United meant the title went to Liverpool instead. Stanley Matthews left with 3 games remaining of the 1946–47 season opting to join Blackpool at the age of 32.

Stoke were relegated from the First Division in 1952–53; during the season Bob McGrory resigned as the club's manager after 17 years in the role. Former Wolverhampton Wanderers defender Frank Taylor took over at the club looking to gain promotion back to the First Division. However after seven seasons in the Second Division without promotion Taylor was sacked. Taylor was shocked at being fired and vowed never to be associated with football again.

===Tony Waddington years===
Tony Waddington was appointed as the club's manager in June 1960. He joined the club in 1952 as a coach before being promoted to assistant manager in 1957. Waddington pulled off a significant coup by enticing Stanley Matthews – then 46 years old – back to the club 14 years after he had departed. The return of Matthews helped Stoke to an improved eighth position in 1961–62. Promotion was achieved in the following season with Stoke finishing as champions. In their first season back in the top flight 1963–64 Waddington guided Stoke to a mid-table finish. Stoke reached the 1964 Football League Cup Final which they lost 4–3 to Leicester City over two legs.

Waddington counted on experience; Dennis Viollet Jackie Mudie Roy Vernon Maurice Setters and Jimmy McIlroy were all players signed in the latter stages of their careers. Matthews was awarded a knighthood for services to football in the 1965 New Year's Honours list. This was followed by his final appearance for the club against Fulham in February 1965 shortly after his 50th birthday. Gordon Banks England's 1966 World Cup-winning goalkeeper joined in 1967 for £52000 from Leicester. Regarded as the best goalkeeper in the world Banks proved to be a shrewd signing for Waddington as he helped the club maintain stability in the First Division. During the close season of 1967 Stoke City played in the one-off United Soccer Association which imported clubs from Europe and South America. Stoke played as the Cleveland Stokers and finished as runner-up of the Eastern Division.

The club won its first major trophy on 4 March 1972 in the League Cup Final against Chelsea. Stoke won 2–1 in front of a crowd of 97852 at Wembley with goals from Terry Conroy and George Eastham. Preceding this victory Stoke had progressed through 11 games in order to reach the final. This included four games with West Ham United in the semi-final; the two-legged tie was replayed twice. Stoke fared well in the FA Cup; the club progressed to the semi-final stage in both the 1970–71 and 1971–72 seasons. However on both occasions Stoke lost to Arsenal in a replay. Stoke also competed in the UEFA Cup in 1972 and 1974 losing at the first attempt to 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Ajax respectively.

In January 1976 the roof of the Butler Street Stand was blown off in a storm. The repair bill of nearly £250000 put the club in financial trouble; key players such as Alan Hudson Mike Pejic and Jimmy Greenhoff were sold to cover the repairs. With the team depleted Stoke were relegated in the 1976–77 season. Waddington after a spell of 17 years in charge left the club after a 1–0 home defeat to Leicester in March 1977.

===Managerial roundabout===
Waddington was replaced by George Eastham in March 1977. However he could not prevent the club's relegation to the Second Division in 1976–77. Eastham left in January 1978 after only ten months in charge and was replaced by Alan Durban from Shrewsbury Town. Durban achieved promotion to the First Division in the 1978–79 season but after consolidating the club's position in the First Division he left to manage Sunderland in 1981. Richie Barker was appointed for the 1981–82 season but was sacked in December 1983 and was replaced by Bill Asprey. Asprey decided to bring back veteran Alan Hudson and the decision paid off as an improved second half of the season saw Stoke avoid relegation on the final day of the 1983–84 season.

The 1984–85 season proved to be disastrous. Stoke finished the season with only 17 points with just three wins all season. Mick Mills was appointed player-manager for the 1985–86 season but was unable to sustain a challenge for promotion in his four seasons as manager and was sacked in November 1989. His successor Alan Ball Jr. became the club's fifth manager in ten years. Ball struggled in his first season in charge 1989–90 and Stoke were relegated to the third tier of English football after finishing bottom of the Second Division. Ball kept his job for the start of the following season 1990–91 but departed during February 1991 in an indifferent season that saw Stoke finish 14th in the Third Division Stoke's lowest league position.

Ball's successor Lou Macari was appointed in May 1991 prior to the start of the 1991–92 season. He clinched silverware for the club; the 1992 Football League Trophy was won with a 1–0 victory against Stockport County at Wembley with Mark Stein scoring the only goal of the match. The following season 1992–93 promotion was achieved from the third tier. Macari left for his boyhood club Celtic in October 1993 to be replaced by Joe Jordan; Stein also departed in a club record £1.5 million move to Chelsea. Jordan's tenure in charge was short leaving the club less than a year after joining and Stoke opted to re-appoint Lou Macari only 12 months after he had left. Stoke finished fourth in 1995–96 but were defeated in the play-off semi-final by Leicester City. Macari left the club at the end of the season. His last match in charge was the final league game at the Victoria Ground. Mike Sheron who was signed two years previously from Norwich City was sold for a club record fee of £2.5 million in 1997.

===Britannia Stadium and the Icelandic takeover===
1997–98 saw Stoke move to its new ground the Britannia Stadium after 119 years at the Victoria Ground. Chic Bates Macari's assistant was appointed manager for the club's first season in the new ground. He did not last long though and was replaced by Chris Kamara in January 1998. Kamara could not improve the club's fortunes either and he too left in April. Alan Durban previously Stoke's manager two decades earlier took charge for the remainder of season. Despite his best efforts Durban was unable to keep the club up as defeat against Manchester City on the final day of the season consigned Stoke to relegation to the third tier.

Brian Little formerly manager of Aston Villa took charge for the 1998–99 season. Despite an impressive start the team's form tailed off dramatically in the latter stages of the season which led to Little leaving the club at the end of the season. His successor Gary Megson was only in the job for four months. Megson was forced to depart following a takeover by Stoke Holding an Icelandic consortium who purchased a 66% share in Stoke City F.C. for £6.6 million. Stoke became the first Icelandic-owned football club outside of Iceland. They appointed the club's first foreign manager Gudjon Thordarson who helped Stoke win the Football League Trophy in the 1999–2000 season with a 2–1 win over Bristol City in front of a crowd of 85057 at Wembley.

Thordarson achieved promotion at the third time of asking in 2001–02 after previous play-off defeats against Gillingham and Walsall. Cardiff City were defeated in the semi-final before a 2–0 win against Brentford at the Millennium Stadium secured promotion. Despite achieving the goal of promotion Thordarson was sacked by Gunnar Gíslason just five days later.

Steve Cotterill was drafted in as Thordarson's replacement prior to the start of the 2002–03 season but resigned in October 2002 after only four months in charge. Tony Pulis was appointed as Stoke's new manager shortly after. Pulis steered Stoke clear of relegation with a 1–0 win over Reading on the final day of the season keeping the club in the division. However Pulis was sacked at the end of the 2004–05 season following disagreement between himself and the club's owners.

Dutch manager Johan Boskamp was named as Pulis' successor on 29 June 2005 only one day after Pulis was sacked. Boskamp brought in a number of new players from Europe but his side was inconsistent and only a mid-table finish was achieved. Boskamp left at the end of the 2005–06 season amidst a takeover bid by former chairman Peter Coates. On 23 May 2006 Coates completed his takeover of Stoke City marking the end of Gunnar Gíslason's chairmanship of the club. Coates chose former manager Tony Pulis as Boskamp's successor in June 2006. Pulis took Stoke close to a play-off place but an eventual eighth-place finish was achieved in the 2006–07 season.

===Return to top-flight football===
Stoke City fans celebrate following promotion to the Premier League 4 May 2008

Stoke won automatic promotion to the Premier League on the final day of the 2007–08 season finishing in second place in the Championship. A 3–1 defeat to Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2008–09 season saw Stoke written off by many media outlets as relegation certainties. Stoke managed to turn the Britannia Stadium into a ""fortress"" making it difficult for teams to pick up points there. In their first home match Stoke defeated Aston Villa 3–2 and wins also came against Tottenham Hotspur Arsenal Sunderland and West Bromwich Albion. After a 2–1 win at Hull City Stoke confirmed their place in the Premier League as the ''Potters'' finished 12th in their return to the top flight with a total of 45 points. Stoke finished the following 2009–10 season in a respectable 11th place with 47 points. Stoke also made it to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup for the first time since 1972 defeating York City Arsenal and Manchester City before losing out to eventual winners Chelsea.

Stoke reached the FA Cup Final for the first time beating Cardiff City Wolverhampton Wanderers Brighton & Hove Albion West Ham United and a famous 5–0 win against Bolton the largest post-war FA Cup semi-final victory. However they lost the final 1–0 to Manchester City. By reaching the final Stoke qualified for the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League. In the Europa League Stoke advanced past Hajduk Split Thun and a tough group containing Beşiktaş Dynamo Kyiv and Maccabi Tel Aviv which Stoke managed to progress through finishing in second position. City's reward was a tie against Spanish giants Valencia and despite putting up a spirited second leg performance Stoke went out 2–0 on aggregate. In the Premier League Stoke made the high-profile signing of Peter Crouch as they finished in a mid-table position for a fourth time. The 2012–13 season saw Stoke make little progress and Pulis left the club by mutual consent on 21 May 2013.

Pulis was replaced by fellow Welshman Mark Hughes who signed a three-year contract on 30 May 2013. Hughes led Stoke to a ninth-place finish in 2013–14 their highest position in the Premier League and best finish since 1974–75. The 2014–15 season saw Stoke again finish in ninth position this time with 54 points. Despite breaking their transfer record twice on Xherdan Shaqiri and then Giannelli Imbula in 2015–16 Stoke did not make any progression and finished in ninth position for a third season running. Stoke declined in 2016–17 finishing in 13th position.

424750,Ashtons,History,"Norman Ashton started his Leeds-based housebuilding business in 1933 and it was incorporated in 1938 as Norman C Ashton Ltd. Following the outbreak of war in 1939 the Company was restricted to contracting for local authorities; it also established a motor repair business. Private housebuilding resumed after the war and when Ashton was floated in 1964 it claimed to be one of the largest housebuilders operating in the West Riding. Growth was only modest thereafter and Ashton was acquired by Orme in 1972.

The Company constructed many homes in the North of England during the 1960s and 1970s.  Ashtons were one of several pioneers of the British three bed semi a style of house used frequently from the 1940s until the 1970s they also built many four and five bedroomed detached houses.  Most Ashtons housing are built in close proximity with council housing; Holt Park in Leeds was a joint project between Ashtons and Leeds City Council.  Ainsty in Wetherby is also a large mixed development with many Ashtons and Leeds City Council houses mixed in.  Many places such as Holt Park Wetherby Knottingley Mirfield and Washington consist of many Ashtons houses.
"
628566,DCEThreads,History,"DCE/RPC was under development but the POSIX committee had not finalised POSIX threads at the time. The Open Group had to make a decision about what to stick with and unfortunately the final POSIX threads were different from their selection.

POSIX Draft 4 threads were limited to begin with (the final standard fixed these). Microsoft adopted DCE/RPC wholesale in Windows NT as MSRPC and also in DCOM. Most of the stability and reliability problems that programmers associate with DCOM services - especially memory leaks exception handling problems and thread cancellation stability issues - can be traced back to the use of POSIX Draft 4 threads.

DCE/RPC is sufficiently complex that the issue of updating it to solve and modernise the POSIX Draft 4 threading problem requires highly skilled and highly specific programming knowledge. Consequently for all that it can accomplish the reference implementation of DCE/RPC languishes due to a lack of information and resources.

The key difference between POSIX Draft 4 threads and the final POSIX threads specification aside from a number of functions being interruptible where others are not is thread cancellation.  DCE/RPC utilises thread cancellation to propagate signals across the ""Remote"" of RPC such that for example a client application terminating a thread results in its corresponding thread on the server also being terminated in the same way.  Unfortunately the final POSIX specification does not include such sophisticated cancellation methodology and given the difficulties that the Unix vendors had in correctly implementing the POSIX threads specification it is not surprising that it was removed.

284656,American Underslung,Design,"The American Underslung's chassis design and huge  wheels gave it a distinctive appearance and it was noticeably lower than other cars from the same era. The chassis was hung below the axles rather than set atop them with the engine and transmission mass moved closer to the ground lowering the center of gravity and giving sports car appearance and handling. The design mounted the engine and body within the frame rails rather than on the top as with other cars of the era. Developed in collaboration with Harry Stutz the 1905 Underslung ""was one of the most significant if unsung automobiles of this century's first decade.""

The automobiles were marketed at the upper price range of the market. Prices for the American Underslung ranged from US$1250 to $4000.

24842,Battle of Spotsylvania Court House,Initial movements,"
===May 7: The race to Spotsylvania===
Movements on May 7 1864; cavalry actions inset


Grant's orders to Meade were to march the night of May 7–8 over two routes reaching Spotsylvania Court House 10 miles (16 km) to the southeast with at least one corps the morning of May 8. Warren's V Corps would take the Brock Road followed by Hancock's II Corps. Sedgwick's VI Corps would head toward Chancellorsville on the Orange Plank Road and then turn south followed by Burnside's IX Corps.

Meade began by ordering Sheridan's Cavalry Corps to clear the Brock Road for the infantry but the troopers soon bogged down. The brigade of Col. J. Irvin Gregg (David Gregg's division) was stopped at Corbin's Bridge on the Catharpin Road by cavalrymen under Wade Hampton and Rooney Lee. Gregg's men withdrew to a field west of Todd's Tavern constructed rudimentary earthworks and repulsed a series of Confederate attacks. Wesley Merritt's Union division encountered Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry behind barricades on the Brock Road about a mile south of Todd's Tavern. Sharp fighting resulted in the late afternoon and by nightfall Sheridan decided against continuing in the dark and ordered his men to bivouac at Todd's Tavern. The first Union infantry began moving at 8 p.m. and their advance was plagued by traffic jams. When Meade reached Todd's Tavern after midnight he was infuriated to see Sheridan's sleeping cavalrymen and ordered them to resume their road clearing operation.

Lee was unsure of Grant's plan. Reconnaissance told him that the river crossing equipment had been removed from Germanna Ford so Grant would not be withdrawing as his predecessors had. The Union Army could either be heading east to Fredericksburg or moving south. In either event the crossroads at Spotsylvania Court House would play an important role so Lee ordered his artillery chief Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton to begin constructing a road through the woods from the Confederate position at the Wilderness due south to the Catharpin Road. He also ordered Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson who had replaced Lt. Gen. James Longstreet in command of the First Corps following that officer's wounding on May 6 to move out along that road. Lee did not indicate any need for haste but Anderson and his men desired to leave the stench of burning forest and dead bodies in the Wilderness so they began marching about 10 p.m.

165240,Mellin transform,Problems with Laplacian in cylindrical coordinate system,"
In the Laplacian in cylindrical coordinates in a generic dimension (orthogonal coordinates with one angle and one radius and the remaining lengths) there is always a term:

For example in 2-D polar coordinates the laplacian is:

This term can be easily treated with the Mellin transform since:

In the story Kaoru is the instructor of a kendo school in Tokyo . The students leave when many people are killed by someone claiming to be the  from the ''Kamiya Kasshin-ryū''"" damaging the school's reputation. Kaoru is saved from the murderous impostor by the real ''Battōsai'' Himura Kenshin now a wanderer who has sworn to stop killing. During the series Kaoru grows fond of Kenshin due to his good actions to society and becomes his ally.

Kaoru also appears in the film version of the series and other media of the franchise including electronic games and a series of original video animations (OVAs). Although Watsuki wanted to design Kaoru ""more cutely"" and to be ""more fashionable"" he toned down those qualities and made her poor and ""down-to-earth"". There was concern that Watsuki might kill her off and critical reception of the character has been mixed.

11389,Pasteurization,Low moisture foods,"There is a common misconception that low numbers of Salmonella are not a problem in lowmoisture foods because these products do not support Salmonella growth. However low numbers of Salmonella in foods can cause illness and the presence of the organism in lowmoisture ready-to-eat foods must be prevented.>

Along other preventative measures pasteurization can make consumption low moisture foods safe. Care should be taken when pasteurizing dry food products. The amount of time needed for a proper pasteurization effect is at lower water activities (dry food products have a low water activity) is a lot longer than for moist products. Instead of making the time longer also the amount of moist in the product can be controlled to increase the pasteurization effect with a shorter treatment time.

255680,Ikat,Types,"Detail of a classic Gujarati ''patola'' of double ikat from the early 19th century. LACMA textile collections.
In '''warp ikat''' it is only the warp yarns that are dyed using the ikat technique. The weft yarns are dyed a solid colour. The ikat pattern is clearly visible in the warp yarns wound onto the loom even before the weft is woven in. Warp ikat is amongst others produced in Indonesia; more specifically in Kalimantan Sulawesi and Sumatra by respectively the Dayaks Torajans and Bataks.

In '''weft ikat''' it is the weaving or weft yarn that carries the dyed patterns.  Therefore the pattern only appears as the weaving proceeds.  Weft ikats are much slower to weave than warp ikat because the weft yarns must be carefully adjusted after each passing of the shuttle to maintain the clarity of the design.

'''Double Ikat''' is a technique in which both warp and the weft are resist-dyed prior to weaving.  Obviously it is the most difficult to make and the most expensive. Double ikat is only produced in three countries: India Japan and Indonesia. The double ikat made in Patan Gujarat in India is the most complicated.  Called ""patola"" it is made using fine silk yarns and many colours.  It may be patterned with a small motif that is repeated many times across the length of a six-meter sari.  Sometimes the Patan double ikat is pictorial with no repeats across its length.  That is each small design element in each colour was individually tied in the warp and weft yarns.  It's an extraordinary achievement in the textile arts.  These much sought after textiles were traded by the Dutch East Indies company for exclusive spice trading rights with the sultanates of Indonesia.  The double ikat woven in the small Bali Aga village Tenganan in east Bali in Indonesia reflects the influence of these prized textiles.  Some of the Tenganan double ikat motifs are taken directly from the patola tradition.  In India double ikat is also woven in Puttapaka Nalgonda District and is called ''Puttapaka Saree.''  In Japan double ikat is woven in the Okinawa islands where it is called ''tate-yoko gasuri''.

'''Pasapalli Ikat''' is a one of the gorgeous Ikkat saree and Pasapalli ikat saree made in Odisha. The word Pasapalli comes from 'Pasa' which means a board game with four clear parts (much like Ludo). Each pasapalli ikat saree or material - which is actually made with the same technique as the famed Sambalpuri Ikat - has some or the other form of this chequered design.

399377,List of The King of Fighters characters,Reception,"The characters from ''The King of Fighters'' series were said to be a varied cast by ''Eurogamer'' magazine since the cast includes characters from other SNK games. IGN agreed commenting that every character has their own unique moves and praising their visuals even though the magazine mentioned that the characters have old two-dimensional designs. IGN criticized that learning the characters' special moves was difficult. In reviews for the first game IGN praised the main character Kyo Kusanagi as one of the most enjoyable characters to play remarking on his dynamism and movesets. GameSpot also praised the characters designs saying they ""shine through resulting in a cast of characters that's diverse and not plentiful"". In other reviews they complained about the lack of improvements in the character's movesets in some games and also mentioned that some techniques were simply removed. They noted that while new characters introduced in some games are interesting they do not have the same impact as other ones.

1UP.com labelled the characters from the series as one of SNK's best creations claiming that their appearances and quotations are all ""cool""—although they commented some of the storylines are ""nonsense"". The boss characters were criticized by multiple reviewers for being too difficult to defeat with Krizalid from ''The King of Fighters '99'' being singled out as too powerful.

The character designs in ''Maximum Impact'' were praised by IGN which noted that the conversion to three-dimensional modeling had ""extremely vibrant"" characters with ""a decent amount of detail."" However they disliked the lack of blood especially during violent attacks saying the super moves and combos were ""just not as spectactular here"" as they were in previous installments. IGN sharply criticized the ""terribly bad voice acting"" calling it ""truly piss-poor American dub work."" Gamezone added that some characters still remain their unique fighting style but complained about the lack of individualized endings and commented that some of the attacks have less style in 3D. ''GameSpot'' also added that the English voices weren't distinctive but commented that their new outfits were ""pretty wild"".  The characters however were ""just not done with the same pixel-perfect flair"" as the 2D versions they said noting that ""you'll recognize the characters because of their clothes and special moves not because of their faces.""

Action figures puzzles keychains and pins have been produced based on the characters in the ''King of Fighters'' series.  Many characters are also featured on posters wallpapers and trading cards.

329821,WPZE,History,"The station is the result of '''Docket 80-90''' the FCC plan to allow more stations on the air by reducing the required spacings. During the mid-1980s it was decided that one of these new stations would be assigned to the west-northwest side of metro Atlanta. Several applicants requested the new allotment be assigned to one of four cities: Mableton Lithia Springs Douglasville and Forest Park. The frequency already belonged to WGHR in Marietta the student radio station at what is now Southern Polytechnic State University — however the forced downgrade to second-class status left the class D station vulnerable. It applied for the new allotment and to have it reserved to Marietta and as noncommercial however the FCC refused this leaving WGHR with no chance of upgrading. The remaining contenders applied in 1988 and had a lengthy battle in court. After many years of legal wrangling over the frequency the station came on the air in 2001 forcing WGHR at SPSU to 100.7 and then off the air completely due to WWWQ's move-in on 100.5.  The station was assigned the call sign '''WAWE''' FM on November 24 1997 during its construction permit.

===As WAMJ ""Grown Folks Radio""===
On June 27 2001 the station was then assigned the '''WAMJ''' call sign just before it went on the air. The call sign was moved from 107.5 FM which then upgraded to a Class C3 station and took on the call sign '''WJZZ-FM''' and adopted a ""Smooth Jazz"" format.  The Urban AC from then-""Majic 107.5"" which originated three years before came along also although the ""Majic"" nickname was never used throughout WAMJ's tenure on 102.5 and took on a more oldies approach to R&B.  (Competitor WALR did this same tactic on 2003 but only because WFOX (now WSRV) was an experimental urban station for a few years.)

In April 2004 Radio One acquired New Mableton Broadcast Corporation (WAMJ's owner) for approximately $35 million. Radio One operated the station under a local marketing agreement beginning in August 2001. Radio One then completed this acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2004 under the name ROA Licenses (Radio One Atlanta Licenses) which also owned WJZZ-FM WPZE-FM and WHTA-FM.

In October 2005 the station changed format to Urban Adult Contemporary with the addition of current R&B and soul songs; it only skewed more to an Urban Oldies/Classic Soul heavy segment of the format months later. The station was branded as ""Grown Folks Radio."" When attempts to secure broadcasting rights to ''The Tom Joyner Morning Show'' failed WAMJ began carrying ''The Steve Harvey Show'' in the mornings and syndicated talk programming (including the Al Sharpton program and ''The Michael Baisden Show'') during the midday and afternoon hours. Evenings and weekends remained dedicated to music however.

===As WPZE ""Praise 102.5""===
WPZE originated its current format in 2001 on 97.5 FM.  On February 16 2009 ""Praise 97.5"" moved to 102.5 FM from 97.5 FM which changed formats to a simulcast of Majic 107.5 (as WUMJ). At this time the WAMJ call sign was returned to 107.5 FM (formerly WJZZ-FM) to reunite with the ""Majic"" branding.  The current incarnation of WPZE is home to the Houston-based Yolanda Adams Morning Show and Coco Brutha Live in the evenings.

10531,Nairobi,Crime and law enforcement,"Throughout the 1990s Nairobi had struggled with rising crime earning a reputation for being a dangerous city and the nickname ""Nairobbery"" a name which persists today. On 7 August 1998 the US Embassy was bombed killing 224 people and injuring 4000. In 2001 the United Nations International Civil Service Commission rated Nairobi as among the most insecure cities in the world classifying the city as ""status C"". In the United Nations report it was stated that in 2001 nearly one third of all Nairobi residents experienced some form of robbery in the city. The head of one development agency cited the notoriously high levels of violent armed robberies burglaries and carjackings. Crime had risen in Nairobi as a result of unplanned urbanisation with a minimal number of police stations and a proper security infrastructure. However many claim that the biggest factor for the city's alarming crime rate is police corruption which leaves many criminals unpunished. As a security precaution most large houses have a watch guard burglar grills and dogs to patrol their grounds during the night. Most crimes however occur around the poor neighbourhoods where it gets dangerous during night hours.

In 2006 crime decreased in the city due to increased security and an improved police presence. Despite this in 2007 the Kenyan government and US State Department have announced that Nairobi is experiencing a greater level of violent crime than in previous years. Since then the government has taken measures to combat crime with heavy police presence in and around the city while US government has updated its travel warning for the country.

Following a grenade attack in October 2011 by a local Kenyan man with terrorist links the city faced a heightened security presence. Fears spread over further promised retaliations by the Al-Shabaab group of rebels over Kenya's involvement in a coordinated operation with the Somalian military against the insurgent outfit.

There have been a spate of Blasts in Nairobi which started on 10 March 2012 where assailants threw grenades at a busy bus station and a blue-collar bar in Nairobi killing nine and injuring more than 50. On 28 May 2012 28 people were injured in an explosion in a shopping complex in downtown Nairobi near Moi avenue. On 21 September 2013 Al-Shabaab-associated militants attacked the Westgate Mall. 67 people were killed.

685132,Swannanoa (mansion),History,"Intended to be a ""summer place"" for Richmond Virginia millionaire and philanthropist James H. Dooley and his wife Sarah ""Sallie"" O. May it reportedly took over 300 artisans eight years to build the structure complete with Georgian marble Tiffany windows gold plumbing fixtures and terraced gardens. Built as a token of love from husband to wife the depth of James and Sallie May’s relationship was represented in the 4000 piece Tiffany stained-glass window and a domed ceiling bearing the likeness of Mrs. Dooley  Despite the lavish expenditure it was occupied only for a few years following completion in 1912.

Major Dooley died in 1924 at the age of 82. He left Swannanoa entirely to his wife Sally Mae along with several million dollars. Sallie May Dooley died in 1926 at the age of 79. She left the estate to Major Dooley's two sisters.

When the property was built it had state-of-the-art fixtures for the time. Electricity and plumbing were installed in the house. It was the first house to have electricity in Nelson County and to accomplish this it had its own power plant on the property. There also was a built in elevator. Like Monticello Thomas Jefferson's house 27 miles away it had a dumbwaiter to bring food up from the basement kitchen to the dining room on the first floor.

The sisters sold Swannanoa in 1926 to the Valley Corporation of Richmond which became the second owner of Swannanoa. They planned and opened a country club in 1929 and closed in 1932. During that time they built the stone building on the property rumored to house the region's best moonshine distillery and which was a favored supplier for government officials during Prohibition. The golf course was an 18-hole course. It was during Swannanoa's time as a country club that Calvin Coolidge had Thanksgiving dinner (1928) at the mansion. The sumptuous accommodations and isolation from the Capitol's hubbub seemed to affect Mrs. Coolidge deeply giving her ""the giddiness of a mare in the spring"" according to the waitstaff. Calvin was typically silent on the subject but seemed rather drawn and sleepy for the next day's hunting.

The United States Navy considered purchasing and renovating the property in 1942 which they calculated would cost $200000 for the purpose of establishing a secret facility to interrogate prisoners of war. The military rejected it in favor of a Civilian Conservation Corps camp in Fort Hunt Virginia code named P. O. Box 1142 because it seemed unlikely that Congress would approve the purchase of such a palatial structure for the purpose. The mansion stood empty through the Great Depression and World War II until it was leased in 1949 to Walter Russell for his University of Science and Philosophy.

506926,Charlotte Bunch,Career,"Shortly after graduating from Duke University Bunch became a youth delegate to the World Council of Churches Conference on Church and Society in Geneva Switzerland. That same year she became president of the University Christian Movement in Washington D.C. for one year.

Following this position Bunch became a Fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington D.C. and she founded the Washington D.C. publications ''Women's Liberation'' and ''Quest: A Feminist Quarterly''.

Through inspiration from Black Nationalism Bunch took part in founding The Furies Collective a group that published its first newspaper ''The Furies'' in January 1972. The goal was to give a voice to lesbian separatism. While the collective only survived for about one year the home of the Furies Collective later was named the first lesbian-related historic landmark in Washington D.C. and became the first lesbian site on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1977 Bunch became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. She participated in or facilitated numerous international workshops and conferences and from 1979 to 1980 she was a consultant to the secretariat for the World Conference for the United Nations Decade on Women which was hosted by WIFP.

In 1989 she founded the Center for Women's Global Leadership at Douglass College Rutgers University of which she remains the founding director and senior scholar. She was succeeded as executive director by Radhika Balakrishnan in September 2009.

The Center for Women's Global Leadership (CWGL) lobbied the United Nations and the international community to view women's rights as a human rights issue. CWGL is a component of the Gender Equality Architecture Reform (GEAR) Campaign working towards the establishment of a new United Nations Gender Entity that works for equality for all of the world's women. Bunch has been a major voice for this campaign. The gender entity was finally created after four years of advocacy on July 2 2010 and deemed UN Women.

At its 20th Anniversary Symposium on March 6 2010 following panel discussions on body economy and movement CWGL organized a tribute to its founder Charlotte Bunch who transitioned on September 1 2009 from her role as executive director to working with CWGL in her new capacity as founding director and senior scholar. Attendees watched a short preview of the then-upcoming documentary film '' Passionate Politics: The Life & Work of Charlotte Bunch''  (2011) directed by Tami Gold which chronicles Bunch’s lifelong personal and political commitment to women’s human rights.

The Center for Women's Global Leadership launched the  Charlotte Bunch Women's Human Rights Strategic Opportunities Fund in recognition of her contributions to the global women's human rights movement.

She has served on the boards of numerous organizations and is currently a member of the Advisory Committee for the Human Rights Watch Women's Rights Division and on the boards of the Global Fund for Women and the International Council on Human Rights Policy. She has been a consultant to many United Nations bodies and recently served on the Advisory Committee for the Secretary General's ''2006 Report to the General Assembly on Violence against Women''.

557510,USS S. P. Lee (DD-310),History,"''S. P. Lee'' was laid down on 31 December 1918 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation San Francisco California; launched by Mrs. Thomas J. Wyche; and commissioned on 30 October 1920 Commander G. T. Swosey Jr. in command.

Assigned to Reserve Destroyer Division Pacific Fleet ''S. P. Lee'' spent most of her first two years in the San Diego California area with a reduced complement. She sailed on 6 February 1923 as part of Destroyer Squadron 11 for combined fleet operations in the Panama Canal Zone. Arriving Balboa 20 days later following exercises en route the destroyer engaged in tactical and strategic maneuvers through the end of March and returned to San Diego on 11 April. From 25 June to 30 August ''S. P. Lee'' and DesRon 11 cruised the coast of Washington putting in at Tacoma Port Angeles and Seattle and serving as escort to President Warren G. Harding in  on his arrival at Seattle on 27 July. She then participated in squadron maneuvers through the end of August with Battleship Division 3 putting in at San Francisco on the 31st.

''S. P. Lee'' sailed for her homeport at 0830 8 September in company with most of DesRon 11 under Captain E. H. Watson in  leading the way. Engaged in a high-speed engineering run down the Pacific Coast the squadron changed course 95° at 2100 as inaccurate navigation indicated it appropriate to make the approach to Santa Barbara Channel. At 2105 ''Delphy'' stranded on the rocks of Point Pedernales known to sailors as Honda or the Devil's Jaw; though warning signals were sent up by the flagship the sheltering configuration of the coast line prevented their recognition by the remaining ships of DesRon 11; and in the ensuing confusion six other destroyers including ''S. P. Lee'' ran aground also in what is known as the Honda Point Disaster.

USS ''S. P. Lee'' (right) aground at Honda Point.

Valiant efforts by the crew to save the ship proved futile and the ship was abandoned the following day and declared a total loss. ''S. P. Lee'' and her sister destroyers were struck from the Navy list on 20 November. Her wreckage was sold on 19 October 1925 to Robert J. Smith of Oakland California. He removed some of the destroyer's equipment but was unable to salvage her.

203755,Melchior de Polignac,Education and Early Career,"
A precocious child he was taken by his uncle to Paris and installed in the Jesuit Collège de Clermont (later named the Collège de Louis le Grand).  At the appropriate time he passed to the Collège de Harcourt where thanks to the misdirected efforts of a teacher who was an enthusiast for Aristotle Polignac adopted the opposite view and became a Cartesian.  His thesis in Theology at the Sorbonne (1683) discussed the Kings of Judah who had destroyed the ""high places"".  He was either prescient or aware of discussion around Louis XIV which led in two years to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) and the removal of the Huguenot ""high places"".  He had somehow attracted the patronage of the Cardinal Emmanuel de la Tour d'Auvergne de Bouillon who took Polignac with him when he went to Rome for the Conclave following the death of Pope Innocent XI on August 12 1689.  Bouillon chose Polignac as one of his Conclavists.  When the new Pope Alexander VIII (Ottoboni) was elected he assisted Cardinal de Bouillon and the French Ambassador the Duc de Chaulnes in attempting to improve relations between Louis XIV and the Holy See.  Polignac was sent back to France to report to Louis who immediately sent him back to Rome with further instructions.  He was still in Rome when Alexander VIII died after less than sixteen months on the throne and was again Conclavist of Cardinal de Bouillon in the Conclave of 1691 that elected Innocent XII (Pignatelli).

At an early age he achieved recognition as a diplomat. In 1693 he was sent as ambassador to Poland where he worked with Cardinal Augustyn Michal Stefan Radziejowski the Primate of Poland and nephew of King John III Sobieski to bring about the election of François-Louis de Bourbon prince de Conti as successor to John Sobieski (1697). The other candidate Augustus the Strong of Saxony however was supported by Austria and Russia and was elected over the French candidate. The subsequent failure of this intrigue led to Polignac's temporary disgrace and retirement to his Abbey of Bon-Port but in 1702 he was restored to favour.  In 1709 he was sent along with Nicholas du Blé Maréchal d'Huxelles as plenipotentiaries  to conduct negotiations toward peace at the Dutch town of Geertruidenberg but thanks to the obstinacy of Louis XIV they were unsuccessful.  Polignac left Getruidenberg on July 25 1710 and had an interview with Louis XIV at Versailles on July 31. In 1712 he was sent again along with the Maréchal d'Huxelles as a plenipotentiary of Louis XIV of France to the Congress of Utrecht and this time a peace was concluded.

12417,Punjabi language,Writing systems,"

Punjabi has two major writing systems in use: Gurmukhi which is a Brahmic script derived from the Laṇḍā script and Shahmukhi which is an Arabic script. The word Gurmukhi translates into ""Guru's mouth"" and Shahmukhi means ""from the King's mouth"".

In the Punjab province of Pakistan the script used is Shahmukhi and differs from the Urdu alphabet in having four additional letters. In the Indian states of Punjab Haryana and Delhi and other parts of India the Gurmukhī script is generally used for writing Punjabi. Historically various local Brahmic scripts including Laṇḍā were also in use.

After the German occupation in 1940 Hjort held lectures in the German-controlled Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation alongside individuals like Albert Wiesener Jonas Lie and Ranik Halle. He was arrested by the Gestapo in 1941 on the orders of Josef Terboven the German Reichskommissar for Norway after Hjort published a scholarly article in a journal of Norwegian law that openly criticised the German occupation.  He was imprisoned first in Oslo and then in Berlin. After being released Hjort and his family carried out important resistance work in Germany playing a crucial role in the first stages of the White Buses operation.  It is estimated that this operation saved 15345 prisoners from death in concentration and prisoner camps; of these 7795 were Scandinavian. In particular 423 Danish Jews were saved from the Theresienstadt concentration camp inside German-occupied terrority of Czechoslovakia contributing significantly to the fact that the casualties among Danish Jews during the Holocaust were among the lowest of the occupied countries of Europe.

There are eight treasures that a player must grab to complete a round except on the bonus round where the player will just want to collect all the balloons that he can. The main intrigue here is getting past a blockade of Meowkies. The player controls are simple - he can bounce in any of the four directions the only places he can land are the centres of the checkerboard squares (making for very few locations overall) and he will move at the same speed as the cats. If the player pushes the accelerator button and runs around he will go twice as fast. When the cats have sped up (after a ""Hurry Up"" warning has appeared) they will match Mappy's accelerated speed.

371010,Universal language,Introduction,"

'''Universal language''' may refer to a hypothetical or historical language spoken and understood by all or most of the world's population.  In some contexts it refers to a means of communication said to be understood by all living things beings and objects alike.  It may be the idea of an international auxiliary language for communication between groups speaking different primary languages.  In other conceptions it may be the primary language of all speakers or the only existing language.   Some religious and mythological traditions state that there was once a single universal language among all people or shared by humans and supernatural beings.

In other traditions there is less interest in or a general deflection of the question. For example in Islam the Arabic language is the language of the Qur'an and so universal for Muslims. The written Classical Chinese language was and is still read widely but pronounced differently by readers in China Vietnam Korea and Japan; for centuries it was a ''de facto'' universal ''literary'' language for a broad-based culture. In something of the same way Sanskrit in India and Nepal Tamil in India and Sri Lanka and Pali in Sri Lanka and in Theravada countries of South-East Asia (Burma Thailand Cambodia) were literary languages for many for whom they were not their mother tongue.

Comparably the Latin language (''qua'' Medieval Latin) was in effect a universal language of literati in the Middle Ages and the language of the Vulgate Bible in the area of Catholicism which covered most of Western Europe and parts of Northern and Central Europe also.

In a more practical fashion trade languages such as ancient Koine Greek may be seen as a kind of ''real'' universal language that was used for commerce.

In historical linguistics monogenesis refers to the idea that all spoken human languages are descended from a single ancestral language spoken many thousands of years ago.

428728,Charles Robert Cockerell,Architectural career,"Cockerell's Hanover Chapel in 1828
Cockerell had grave doubts about the wisdom of using Greek Revival architecture in nineteenth-century England in his diary of 1821 he had this to say:

Until the attention of the world was drawn to the study of Greece by the spirit of the last century by Barthélemy's Anacharsis & thence to the study of Greek architecture by the researches of Stuart & Revett architecture had for its guide this Country the Old Italian masters & their valuable commentaries & publications of the ancient architecture of Rome and Italy. No great enormities could arise under such guidance but since the rage for Greek has been amongst us all the rules which formerly protected us are now set aside & we are at sea without compas ...we stick a slice of an ancient Greek Temple to a Barn which is called breadth & simplicity than which nothing can be more absurd as the Greek Houses were certainly of wood & brick & plaister Sic painted & temporary things. I am sure that the grave & solemn architecture of Temples were never adopted to Houses but a much lighter style as we may judge by the vases the object being space & commodiousness.


Cockerell's first building (1818–20) was in the style of Tudor architecture the brick building at Harrow School now known as the 'old schools' has twin crow-stepped gables. His next commission was the classical Hanover Chapel (1821–25) Regent Street with its twin towers and projecting tetrastyle Ionic portico later demolished (1896).

570284,Sherlockiana,Introduction,"'''Sherlockiana''' is a broad term relating to memorabilia and non-canonical works of fiction about or referring to the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes.

Sherlockiana ranges from serious treatments of the character such as the novel ''The Seven-Per-Cent Solution'' by Nicholas Meyer to outright parody such as the recording ''The Tale of the Giant Rat of Sumatra'' by the Firesign Theatre and Gene Wilder's ''The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother''.  Shows such as ''CSI'' will sometimes refer to Holmes or use Holmes-like imagery in their mysteries.

Charles Spencer former theater critic for ''The Daily Telegraph'' used the term to refer to the 2009-12 releases of ''The House of Silk'' ''Sherlock (TV series)'' and the two Sherlock Holmes films (''Sherlock Holmes'' and ''A Game of Shadows'') as representative of a ""golden age of Sherlockiana.""

The Sherlockian game is a pastime of attempting to resolve anomalies and clarify implied details about Holmes and Watson.

Trombidium) is used as Unani Medicine

'''''Yunani''''' or '''''Unani''''' medicine (Urdu:  ''tibb yūnānī'') is the term for Perso-Arabic traditional medicine as practiced in Mughal India and in Muslim culture in South Asia and modern day Central Asia. The term is derived from Arabic ''Yūnānī'' ""Greek"" as the Perso-Arabic system of medicine was in turn based on the teachings of the Greek physicians Hippocrates and Galen.

The Hellenistic origin of Unani medicine is still visible in its being based on the classical four humours: Phlegm (Balgham) Blood (Dam) Yellow bile (Ṣafrā') and Black bile (Saudā') but it has also been influenced by Indian and Chinese traditional systems.

"
528697,Graham Dilley,Life and career,"Dilley was born and raised in Dartford Kent England attended Dartford High School. and played his early cricket for Dartford Cricket Club at Hesketh Park. He trained as a diamond cutter in Hatton Garden before embarking on a cricketing career with Kent County Cricket Club. He played for the Kent Second XI in 1976 aged 17.

He was married and divorced twice.  Kent cricketer Graham Johnson was a brother-in-law.  He had four children including Chris Pennell vice captain of Worcester Warriors rugby team. His youngest son Jonathan has also represented Gloucestershire Second XI as a Left Arm Orthodox Spin Bowler. 

===Early career===
Dilley made his first class debut for Kent at the age of eighteen in 1977 against Cambridge University.  He failed to take a wicket and was not selected again until the following season.  He played his second match in June 1978 against the touring Pakistani cricket team but again failed to take a wicket.  It was only in his third first-class match against Middlesex that he made his presence felt taking seven wickets in the match to help his team to a six-wicket win.

Dilley played two more first-class matches that season but took only one wicket. Perhaps more significant was his selection for England Young Cricketers against their West Indian counterparts for two of the three ""Tests"" and the single one-day game. Real progress in county cricket however would have to wait for 1979 when Dilley played 31 senior games for Kent including a useful effort of 4–41 in the World Cup warm-up match against the New Zealanders. He finished with 49 first-class wickets at an average of 23.48 that season and already his express pace was attracting attention.

===England selection===
The England selectors looking for a young fast bowler for that winter's tour of Australia took the bold decision of including the 20-year-old Dilley in the squad and he made his international debut in an ODI against West Indies played as part of the triangular tournament featuring those two teams and Australia.

Dilley played his first One Day International match on 24 November 1979 against West Indies at Sydney during the 1979/80 Benson & Hedges World Series Cup. The match was won by England by two runs.  Dilley was given the new ball and struck in his third over when he claimed the wicket of Desmond Haynes. Rain forced the match to have a revised target and the West Indies needed to score 198 runs in 47 overs to win the match. They fell short and lost the match. Dilley finished with 6–2–21–1 with an economy rate of 3.50 runs per over.

A fortnight later Dilley appeared in his first Test match making him the youngest cricketer to play for England in thirty years when he entered the field during the Perth Test at the WACA on 14 December 1979. English captain Mike Brearley showed confidence in Dilley and gave him the new ball at the start of the Australian first innings. Dilley did well during his initial bowling spell but had to wait until Australia lost their fifth wicket on 127 runs to claim his first Test Wicket. The batsman was Peter Toohey caught by Derek Underwood for 19.  Dilley then claimed his second wicket when Rod Marsh was caught behind by Bob Taylor. Marsh had scored 42 runs and Australia were 219 for 7 at that point. Australia finished 244 all out and Dilley took figures of 18–1–47–2 with an economy rate of 2.61. However his debut bowling performance was over-shadowed by Botham taking 6 for 78.

England were all out for 228 giving a lead of 16 runs to Australia. Dilley scored an unbeaten 38 and stayed at the wicket for 206 minutes facing 57 balls. His score was the second highest in the innings after captain Mike Brearley. Dilley again took the new ball in Australia's second innings but did not get a wicket until Dennis Lillee gave a catch to Peter Willey at gully. Lillee scored 19 runs and England needed 354 runs for victory. Geoff Boycott showed resistance with an unbeaten 99 and Dilley made a partnership of nineteen runs with Boycott for eighth wicket. England finished 215 all out and Australia won the Test by 138 runs.

He acquitted himself reasonably well taking three wickets and scoring a handy unbeaten 38 in the first innings. The game featured a memorable item on the second-innings scorecard:
:Lillee  c Willey b Dilley 19

England lost the match by 138 runs and although Dilley also played in the second Test which was also lost he was replaced by John Lever for the third and final game. Dilley took only seven wickets on that tour – ""£7000 for seven wickets"" as the tour manager Alec Bedser commented.  The Australians triumphed in this match as well to win the rubber 3–0 although the Ashes were not at stake and were retained by England on the basis of their 5–1 victory in the six-game series that had been played a year earlier.

In 1980 Dilley was not selected until the third Test against West Indies at Old Trafford. Rain intervened as it was to do in the fourth and fifth Tests as well and all were drawn. Dilley's eleven wickets in the three innings he was able to make use of made sure of his place to face the same opponents in the Caribbean that winter. England were outplayed in the overseas Tests and lost the four-match series 2–0 (the Guyana Test having been cancelled over the Robin Jackman affair) and both ODIs but Dilley's ten wickets were enough for him to retain his place for the 1981 Ashes series.



Dilley began the 1981 Ashes series strongly taking 12 wickets in the first two Tests and was thus retained for the third Test at Headingley. This game is best remembered for England's sensational victory after following on and for the heroics of Ian Botham and Bob Willis but Dilley played his part as well albeit in the unfamiliar role of batsman.  Coming to the crease in the second innings with England at 135–7 92 runs in arrears Dilley had no orders from his captain Mike Brearley when he joined Ian Botham at the crease.  Botham said ""Right then let's have a bit of fun"" and the two men put on 117 in just 80 minutes before Dilley (56 from 75 balls) was bowled by Terry Alderman.  England eventually established a lead of 130 and Dilley then held a boundary catch to dismiss Rod Marsh in Australia's second innings.  Exceptional bowling by Bob Willis (8–43) bowled Australia out for 111 and gave England an unexpected victory by 18 runs.

Despite his part in the win at Headingley  Dilley did not play in the fourth Test nor in the two that followed being replaced variously by John Emburey Paul Allott and Mike Hendrick. He did get picked for the subsequent 1981/2 India tour having pulled out of Graham Gooch's rebel tour of South Africa something he regretted for financial reasons.

===Injury and recovery===
Despite being in and out of the side for the next couple of years Dilley's future as a Test player seemed reasonably bright by 1983 as he played a full part in England's World Cup campaign. Following the tournament a neck injury forced him out of the game for a year and although he returned to county cricket in 1985 there was some doubt as to his long-term prospects. A decent performance that winter for Natal helped in his rehabilitation and by 1986 Dilley took 63 first-class wickets and earned a recall to the England side.

Between 1986 and 1988 Dilley took 83 Test wickets at an average of 26.43 and was generally regarded as England's foremost strike bowler. He developed significant pace and outswing from a long wide run up approaching the wicket at an angle almost 45 degrees.  Perhaps his most significant success came in 1986/87 when he took 5–68 in the first innings of the first Test at Brisbane to help his team to a victory that set them on their way to an Ashes win and he also took 20 wickets at 15.85 in ODIs. In the drawn series against New Zealand the following winter he produced his career-best bowling figures ripping through the Kiwi line-up with 6–38 (including the first five wickets to fall) at Lancaster Park Christchurch. He was fined £250 in the same match for swearing at the umpire comments which were clearly picked up by the stump microphone. He took a further 5–60 in Auckland and finished the series with fifteen wickets at an average of 14.

===Bowling style===
His bowling style often fascinated many with his unusual run-up a topic of discussion. It is believed that he tried to adopt the Jeff Thomson's slingy bowling style and later Dilley's style was used by Chris Cairns in New Zealand. 

In 1988 when talking about the effects of coaching fast bowlers Geoffrey Boycott commented ""Remember what happened to Graham Dilley who started out as a genuinely quick bowler. They started stuffing line and length in his ear and now he has Dennis Lillee's action with Denis Thatcher's pace"".

===Later career===
For the 1987 season Dilley moved to Worcestershire and his new county were about to begin the most successful period in their history winning four trophies in the next three years. Despite further injury problems he proved a vital cog in the wheel as Worcestershire won the 1988 and 1989 County Championships; it was during this period that he wrote with team-mate Graeme Hick an account of one of the title-winning seasons somewhat painfully entitled ''Hick'n'Dilley Circus''.

Dilley's Test career was beginning to wind down by this time and his final match was at Edgbaston in the 1989 Ashes series. He made certain that he would not be picked again by accompanying Mike Gatting on the rebel tour to South Africa that winter although he continued to play for his county for a couple more years. Dilley appeared in three of Worcestershire's matches in April 1992 but despite a couple of appearances in the Second XI he announced his retirement at the end of that season because of recurring injury problems.

===Retirement===
Dilley's move to Worcestershire denied him the financial security of a benefit season.  He found employment after retirement as a coach firstly to the England women's cricket team and then accompanying the men's side on the tour to India in 2001/02. He also worked in a coaching capacity for Zimbabwe and Scotland. His last position was as head coach to Loughborough UCCE where he was director of cricket for 11 years. where he coached among others Monty Panesar James Anyon Ruel Brathwaite James Adams and Rob Taylor.

===Personal life===
Dilley was the father of the Worcester Warriors rugby union captain Chris Pennell.

Dilley died in a hospice in Leicester on 5 October 2011 just one week after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer at the age of 52. A memorial service was held in Worcester Cathedral on Wednesday 9 November 2011.

This appointment ended in 1800 when Symington took over management of the Grange colliery near Bo'ness. William Cadell was behind Symington at this job.

In 1804 he joined a local businessman in a partnership intended to manage the Callendar colliery at Falkirk. A new pump was needed there and this allowed Symington to develop what he called a 'lifting engine'. He may have built one of these for the Wanlockhead mines in 1789.

The Callendar venture ended badly however and in a dispute at the High Court in Edinburgh that lasted until 1810 Symington lost.

97938,Voronoi diagram,Higher-order Voronoi diagrams,"Although a normal Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points closest to a single point in ''S'' an ''n''th-order Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points having a particular set of ''n'' points in ''S'' as its ''n'' nearest neighbors.  Higher-order Voronoi diagrams also subdivide space.

Higher-order Voronoi diagrams can be generated recursively.  To generate the ''n''th-order Voronoi diagram from set ''S'' start with the (''n'' − 1)th-order diagram and replace each cell generated by ''X'' = {''x''1 ''x''2 ... ''x''''n''−1} with a Voronoi diagram generated on the set ''S'' − ''X''.

===Farthest-point Voronoi diagram===
For a set of ''n'' points the (''n'' − 1)th-order Voronoi diagram is called a farthest-point Voronoi diagram.

For a given set of points ''S'' = {''p''1 ''p''2 ... ''p''''n''} the farthest-point Voronoi diagram divides the plane into cells in which the same point of ''P'' is the farthest point. A point of ''P'' has a cell in the farthest-point Voronoi diagram if and only if it is a vertex of the convex hull of ''P''. Let ''H'' = {''h''1 ''h''2 ... ''h''''k''} be the convex hull of ''P''; then the farthest-point Voronoi diagram is a subdivision of the plane into ''k'' cells one for each point in ''H'' with the property that a point ''q'' lies in the cell corresponding to a site ''h''''i'' if and only if d(''q'' ''h''''i'') > d(''q'' ''p''''j'') for each ''p''''j'' ∈ ''S'' with ''h''''i'' ≠ ''p''''j'' where d(''p'' ''q'') is the Euclidean distance between two points ''p'' and ''q''.

The boundaries of the cells in the farthest-point Voronoi diagram have the structure of a topological tree with infinite rays as its leaves. Every finite tree is isomorphic to the tree formed in this way from a farthest-point Voronoi diagram.

240262,Victory at Sea,History,"The project was conceived by Henry Salomon who while a U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander during World War II was a research assistant to historian Samuel Eliot Morison. Morison was then writing the 15-volume ''History of United States Naval Operations in World War II''. During this period Salomon learned of the large amounts of film that the warring navies had compiled. Salomon left the Navy in 1948 and eventually discussed his idea of a documentary series with one of his Harvard classmates Robert Sarnoff a rising executive at NBC television and the son of David Sarnoff the chairman of RCA (then the owner of NBC).

NBC approved the project in 1951 with Salomon as producer and a budget of $500000 (large for that era). His team composed largely of newsreel veterans searched naval archives around the world and received complete cooperation from the U.S. Navy which recognized the publicity value. Salomon's team compiled 60 million feet (18300 km) of film which was edited to about 61000 feet for broadcast.

After the original run NBC syndicated it to local stations where it proved successful financially through the mid-1960s. NBC also marketed the series overseas; by 1964 it had been broadcast in 40 foreign markets. NBC created a feature-length (89-minute) motion picture condensation. The feature-length version was narrated by Alexander Scourby who replaced Leonard Graves the narrator of the 26-part series. NBC made a distribution deal with United Artists and the film debuted in mid-1954. NBC also prepared another 79-minute condensation for broadcast and it debuted on 29 December 1960 in a 90-minute evening slot as part of NBC's ''Project Twenty'' (""Project XX"") series which itself was established in 1955 as an offshoot of original ''Victory at Sea'' production unit.

The TV series won many honors including the Emmy and Peabody Award.

98813,Flag of Scotland,Protocol,"
===Use by the Scottish Government===
Scottish Government logo
The Scottish Government has ruled that the Saltire should where possible fly on all its buildings every day from 8am until sunset. An exception is made for United Kingdom ""national days"" when on buildings where only one flagpole is present the Saltire shall be lowered and replaced with the Union Flag. Such flag days are standard throughout the United Kingdom with the exception of Merchant Navy Day (3 September) which is a specific flag day in Scotland during which the Red Ensign of the Merchant Navy may be flown on land in place of either the Saltire or Union Flag.

A further Scottish distinction from the UK flag days is that on Saint Andrew's Day (30 November) the Union Flag will only be flown where a building has more than one flagpole; the Saltire will not be lowered to make way for the Union Flag where a single flagpole is present. If there are two or more flagpoles present the Saltire may be flown in addition to the Union Flag but not in a superior position. This distinction arose after Members of the Scottish Parliament complained that Scotland was the only country in the world where the potential existed for the citizens of a country to be unable to fly their national flag on their country's national day. (In recent years embassies of the United Kingdom have also flown the Saltire to mark St Andrew's Day). Many bodies of the Scottish Government use the flag as a design basis for their logo; for example Safer Scotland's emblem depicts a lighthouse shining beams in a saltire shape onto a blue sky. Other Scottish bodies both private and public have also used the saltire in similar ways.

===Use by military institutions on land===

The seven British Army Infantry battalions of the Scottish Division plus the Scots Guards and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards regiments use the Saltire in a variety of forms. Combat and transport vehicles of these Army units may be adorned with a small (130x80mm approx.) representation of the Saltire; such decals being displayed on the front and/or rear of the vehicle. (On tanks these may also be displayed on the vehicle turret). In Iraq during both Operation Granby and the subsequent Operation Telic the Saltire was seen to be flown from the communications whip antenna of vehicles belonging to these units. Funerals conducted with full military honours of casualties of these operations in Iraq (plus those killed in operations in Afghanistan) have also been seen to include the Saltire; the flag being draped over the coffin of the deceased on such occasions.

In the battle for ""hearts and minds"" in Iraq the Saltire was again used by the British Army as a means of distinguishing troops belonging to Scottish regiments from other coalition forces in the hope of fostering better relations with the civilian population in the area south west of Baghdad. Leaflets were distributed to Iraqi civilians by members of the Black Watch depicting troops and vehicles set against a backdrop of the Saltire.

Immediately prior to and following the merger in March 2006 of Scotland's historic infantry regiments to form a single Royal Regiment of Scotland a multi-million-pound advertising campaign was launched in Scotland in an attempt to attract recruits to join the reorganised and simultaneously rebranded ""Scottish Infantry"". The recruitment campaign employed the Saltire in the form of a logo; the words ""Scottish Infantry. Forward As One."" being placed next to a stylised image of the Saltire. For the duration of the campaign this logo was used in conjunction with the traditional Army recruiting logo; the words ""Army. Be The Best."" being placed beneath a stylised representation of the Union Flag. Despite this multi-media campaign having had mixed results in terms of overall success the Saltire continues to appear on a variety of Army recruiting media used in Scotland.

Other uses of the Saltire by the Army include the cap badge design of the Royal Regiment of Scotland which consists of a (silver) Saltire surmounted by a (gilt) lion rampant and ensigned with a representation of the Crown of Scotland. (This same design save for the Crown is used on both the Regimental flag and tactical recognition flash of the Royal Regiment of Scotland). The badge of the No. 679 (The Duke of Connaught's) Squadron Army Air Corps bears a Saltire between two wreaths ensigned 'Scottish Horse'; an honour they received in 1971 which originated through their links with the Royal Artillery. The Officer Training Corps units attached to universities in Edinburgh and Glasgow plus the Tayforth University OTC all feature the Saltire in their cap badge designs.

The Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy adorned three of their aircraft with the Saltire. Specifically the Westland Sea King Mk5 aircraft of HMS ''Gannet'' operating in the Search and Rescue (SAR) role from Royal Naval Air Station Prestwick Ayrshire displayed a Saltire decal on the nose of each aircraft. (The SAR function was transferred from the Royal Navy to Bristow Helicopters acting on behalf of HM Coastguard part of the UK's Maritime and Coastguard Agency with effect from 1 January 2016.)

Although not represented in the form of a flag the No. 602 (City of Glasgow) Squadron of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force uses the Saltire surmounted by a lion rampant as the device shown on the squadron crest. The station crest of the former RAF Leuchars Fife also showed the Saltire in this case surmounted by a sword. The crest of the former RAF East Fortune East Lothian also showed a sword surmounting the Saltire however unlike Leuchars this sword was shown inverted and the station crest of the former RAF Turnhouse Edinburgh showed a Saltire surmounted by an eagle's head. The East of Scotland Universities Air Squadron crest features a Saltire surmounted by an open book; the book itself being supported by red lions rampant.

===General use===
In Scotland the Saltire can be flown at any time by any individual company local authority hospital or school without obtaining express consent. Many local authorities in Scotland fly the Saltire from Council Buildings however in 2007 Angus Council approved a proposal to replace the Saltire on Council Buildings with a new Angus flag based on the council's coat of arms. This move led to public outcry across Scotland with more than 7000 people signing a petition opposing the council's move leading to a compromise whereby the Angus flag would not replace but be flown alongside the Saltire on council buildings.

In the United Kingdom owners of vehicles registered in Great Britain have the option of displaying the Saltire on the vehicle registration plate in conjunction with the letters ""SCO"" or alternatively the word ""Scotland"". In 1999 the Royal Mail issued a series of pictorial stamps for Scotland with the '2nd' value stamp depicting the Flag of Scotland. In Northern Ireland sections of the Protestant community routinely employ the Saltire as a means of demonstrating and celebrating their Ulster-Scots heritage.

Royal Scots Navy red ensign. Use of the Saltire at sea as a ''Jack'' or ''courtesy flag'' has been observed including as a ''Jack'' on the Scottish Government's Marine Partrol Vessel (MPV) ''Jura''.  The ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne routinely flies the Saltire as a ''Jack'' on vessels which have a bow staff including when such vessels are underway. This practice has also been observed on the Paddle Steamer Waverley when operating in and around the Firth of Clyde. The practice of maritime vessels adopting the Saltire for use as a ''jack'' or ''courtesy flag'' may lead to possible confusion in that the Saltire closely resembles the maritime signal flag '''M''' ''""MIKE""'' which is used to indicate ""''My vessel is stopped; making no way.''"" Obviously mariners who understand this signal code also understand that the saltire is displayed on the jackstaff and not as a signal. For the benefit of Scottish seafarers wishing to display a Scottish flag other than the Saltire thereby avoiding confusion and a possible fine a campaign was launched in November 2007 seeking official recognition for the historic Scottish Red Ensign. Despite having last been used officially by the pre-Union Royal Scots Navy and merchant marine fleets in the 18th century the flag continues to be produced by flag manufacturers and its unofficial use by private citizens on water has been observed.

In May 2016 the Saltire was flown from horseback during The Queen's 90th birthday celebration at Windsor alongside the flags of England Northern Ireland and Wales.

158235,Louis XVI and the Legislative Assembly,The politics of the Left,"The Left had three objects of enmity. First among these was the royal couple King Louis XVI Queen Marie Antoinette and the royal family. 
The Left as a whole wished to replace the monarchy with a republic although this was not initially the public position of most of them. Second came the ''émigrés'' – now seen as a threat from abroad—and third the non-juring clergy.

Those ''émigrés'' who had assembled in arms on the territories of the electors of Mainz and Treves (Trier) and in the Austrian Netherlands had put themselves in the position of public enemies. Their chiefs were the king's brothers who affected to consider Louis as a captive and his acts as therefore invalid. The count of Provence gave himself the airs of a regent and surrounded himself with a ministry. The 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' writes that the only actual danger posed by the ''émigrés'' was symbolic: that they were only a few thousand strong; that they had no competent leader and no money; and that although they had earlier been of some diplomatic significance they were increasingly unwelcome to the rulers whose hospitality they abused. However Mignet claims that the threat was more substantive and their numbers growing and that ""the ambassadors of the emigrants were received while those of the French government were dismissed ill received or even thrown into prison as in the case of M. Duveryer.""

The non-juring clergy – those who refused to take an oath under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy – although harassed by the local authorities kept the respect and confidence of most Catholics. The 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' reports that ""No acts of disloyalty were proved against them and commissioners of the National Assembly reported to its successor that their flocks only desired to be let alone. But the anti-clerical bias of the Legislative Assembly was too strong for such a policy."" Mignet however quotes the marquis de Ferrières ""Priests and especially bishops employed all the resources of fanaticism to excite the people in town and country against the civil constitution of the clergy"" and points out that Bishops ordered the priests no longer to perform divine service in the same church with the constitutional priests. It was increasingly unlikely that two rival Churches could co-exist. Insurrection along religious lines broke out in Calvados Gévaudan and the Vendée (''see Revolt in the Vendée)''.

36338,Hyperthermia,Introduction,"


'''Hyperthermia''' is elevated body temperature due to failed thermoregulation that occurs when a  body produces or absorbs more heat than it dissipates.  Extreme temperature elevation then becomes a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment to prevent disability or death.


The most common causes include heat stroke and adverse reactions to drugs.  The former is an acute temperature elevation caused by exposure to excessive heat or combination of heat and humidity that overwhelms the heat-regulating mechanisms.  The latter is a relatively rare side effect of many drugs particularly those that affect the central nervous system. Malignant hyperthermia is a rare complication of some types of general anesthesia.

Hyperthermia differs from fever in that the body's temperature set point remains unchanged. The opposite is hypothermia which occurs when the  temperature drops below that required to maintain normal metabolism. The term is from Greek  ὑπέρ ''hyper'' meaning ""above"" or ""over"" and  θέρμος ''thermos'' meaning ""hot"".

==Classification== 

In humans hyperthermia is defined as a temperature greater than  depending on the reference used that occurs without a change in the body's  temperature set point.

The normal human body temperature can be as high as  in the late afternoon.  Hyperthermia requires an elevation from the temperature that would otherwise be expected.  Such elevations range from mild to extreme; body temperatures above  can be life-threatening.
